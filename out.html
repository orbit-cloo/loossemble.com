            What does application security and football have in common? In both cases, there is an offense who leads different attacks to try to breach their opponent. The defense is then set up in a way to prevent and minimize the impact of those attacks. Football teams have three levels of defense, and within those levels, there are different positions with different specializations. This is the ultimate defense in depth strategy where coaches predict hundreds of likely plays in order to build a playbook of possible protection scenarios. By consistently practicing and preparing for those possible scenarios, defensive players are able to stop attacks early with minimal gain. Just as a well-coordinated defense protects a team from scoring, a robust application security strategy safeguards digital assets from cyberattacks. By understanding the parallels between maintaining secure code and football defense, developers can continue to create and maintain secure open source software.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            While the talk will focus on the more broad topic of application security and maintaining secure code, a majority of the storytelling will be on open source security. This will include talking about different open source vulnerabilities and how to use defense in depth techniques to prevent future open source vulnerabilities. No prior knowledge of football or application security is needed to attend this talk.

            These days we all spend a lot of time developing for Kubernetes.  Wouldn&#39;t it be great if you could develop and test your containerized application from an easy-to-use desktop application, and not need to touch Kubernetes clusters until you&#39;re ready for staging?  With Podman Desktop and Bluefin Linux, you can!
           </p>
           <p>
            In this demo-heavy presentation, we will go over the workflow of a containerized application developer working on a simple application (the open source project Elekto), making changes, running local tests, and finally deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.  We&#39;ll then demostrate some of the other capabilities of Podman Desktop, including developing system images using BootC.  No previous knowledge of Kubernetes is required.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you regularly work on applications targeting Kubernetes, or if you want to, you&#39;ll learn about a set of tools designed to make your life easier and your development speedier.

            When working with systemd there can be edge cases or &#34;gotchas&#34; that run counter to how you think systemd should behave. In this talk we&#39;ll go over a couple of them and suggestions on how to resolve or work around such situations.

            In this talk I&#39;ll break down the winding road that got us to a place of so many titles and share experiences, my own and others, on the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of so many roles.  We&#39;ll also step back and look at other industries to seek for some parallels we might draw upon.  Finally I&#39;ll attempt to provide a working solution to the problem.  My hope is for this talk to be interactive and engaging for the entire audience.

            COSMIC DE is a new, full-featured desktop environment (like GNOME and KDE) written from scratch in the Rust programming language. It does not rely on GTK or Qt. Instead COSMIC uses a new Rust GUI toolkit called iced and the system76 developed libcosmic toolkit for building interfaces and applications with advanced theming and customization features.
           </p>
           <p>
            COSMIC DE includes a suite of first-party applications including a file browser, text editor, application store, settings, and terminal. There is also a growing community of third-party apps. COSMIC includes a custom compositor that features variable refresh rate, Xwayland support, animations, fractional scaling, modern hybrid graphics features, window snapping and auto-tiling.
           </p>
           <p>
            What makes COSMIC truly unique is that it&#39;s the first modular, composable desktop environment. For a user that means they can easily adapt COSMIC to their preferred workflow. Linux distributions can create wholly unique user experiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            And companies can develop unique products using COSMIC.Carl will discuss why system76 built COSMIC DE, show its features, and demonstrate how unique experiences can be composed with COSMIC DE.

            Using someone else&#39;s cloud to sync photos, calendars and contacts? Proprietary services like iCloud are convenient, but only if you are in the Apple ecosystem. You can get many of the same basic cloud features in a self-hosted Nextcloud instance and sync files, calendars, and contacts on Linux, Mac and mobile devices. This talk discusses how to set up Nextcloud and configure Linux and Mac desktops and iOS mobile devices to use it, especially convenient if your household isn&#39;t 100% Linux (or 100% Mac).

            The RamaLama project&#39;s goal is to make working with AI boring through the use of OCI containers.
           </p>
           <p dir="auto">
            RamaLama tool facilitates local management and serving of AI Models.
           </p>
           <p dir="auto">
            On first run RamaLama inspects your system for GPU support, falling back to CPU support if no GPUs are present.
           </p>
           <p dir="auto">
            RamaLama uses container engines like Podman or Docker to pull the appropriate OCI image with all of the software necessary to run an AI Model for your systems setup.
           </p>
           <p dir="auto">
            Running in containers eliminates the need for users to configure the host system for AI. After the initialization, RamaLama runs the AI Models within a container based on the OCI image.
           </p>
           <p dir="auto">
            RamaLama then pulls AI Models from model registires. Starting a chatbot or a rest API service from a simple single command. Models are treated similarly to how Podman and Docker treat container images.

            Everyone’s talking about AI writing code. But what about AI shipping code? How will LLMs change how we build, test and deploy software? Will Devops as we know it continue to exist? Will our favorite tools become obsolete, or endure? And what about us, the platform builders? Is this our golden age, or the beginning of the end?
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, Solomon Hykes, creator of Docker and co-founder of Dagger.io, takes us on a journey through time, as we retrace the history of software’s industrial revolution, and explore the ramifications of the AI revolution for our community - the engineers running the world’s software factories.

            Opening ports in your firewall to access services running in your LAN is an insecure and outdated way to operate. Find out how to share any self-hosted service, running anywhere in the world, behind almost any kind of NAT, with friends and family without exposing your homelab to the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ll demonstrate how to self-host a few services like Jellyfin (Media Server), Immich (photo backup) and Nextcloud and share them from a VM running in my homelab basement behind a residential firewall with NAT using Tailscale node sharing. I put a DNS entry in public Cloudflare with the Tailscale private IP and show folks how they don’t need to expose their homelabs to the internet any longer and provide access via a secure and encrypted VPN tunnel. The homelab runs Proxmox, NixOS and the services run mostly using docker.

            Some signs that you may want to think about upgrading postgres:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             You have to click on the “Unsupported versions” row to double check everything you read in the docs
            </li>
            <li>
             You hear about a feature that has been around since postgres 11 (or 9.3) and wish that you were able to use it
            </li>
            <li>
             Whenever you mention the version you are running, people mention how out of date it is
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It&#39;s easy to find advice telling you to upgrade, but it can be harder to find answers when things get tricky. I may not have all of those answers, but I want you at least to know that you are not alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            The story of how I upgraded our main database from 9.2 to 15 at Academia.edu had its share of unexpected challenges. I learned a lot about various aspects of postgres, strategies for managing large projects in the data layer, and above all the importance of empathy.

            Package maintenance is an often underappreciated, but critical area of software development. This is the primary mechanism for how software is installed on Linux distros such as Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Ubuntu. Also available on other OSes through homebrew on MacOS and chocolatey or winget on Windows platform.  (NOTE: Source-based package systems such as Gentoo’s portage, ArchLinux’s AUR, Slackware’s pkgtools, and BSD’s ports will not be covered.)
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            In its most basic form, a [binary] package is an archive, like a tarball (or other formats such as ar, cpio, squashfs, etc.) plus metadata that includes the package name, version, dependencies, conflicts, etc. Additionally often contains pre-install, post-install, and post-removal actions or scripts, such as running ldconfig, creating symlinks, or updating a database (.desktop, manpages).
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Most package formats involve a piece of software known as a package manager, which is responsible for resolving the dependency graph, installing the files into the correct locations, and determining which pieces of software can be upgraded, from a number of different sources known as repositories.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            This is where the complexity comes from and packaging done correctly just works, to the point where the user does not even notice; however, even a small oversight can result in installation of an undesired version, prevent installation via [recursive] dependency hell or file conflicts, break the package manager, or even in extreme cases break the repository.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            The latter case involves phone calls or messages from extremely irate users. It can be something small like a %pretrans scriplet in a RPM that only returns non-zero, during a fresh OS installation using a Kickstart config file, that fails the entire transaction. Or package generated using something other than dpkg-buildpackage, which results in non-uniform Debian repository metadata.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            A fun apt-get error to debug is “Depends___  but it’s not going to be installed”, which needs to be followed through the dependency tree until a leaf is found, indicating the missing expected package version that cannot be resolved. Another is different repositories containing packages that “Provides” the same dependency, leading to all manner of difficult to reproduce deviations. Or to flip the perspective, as one user described it, the software only installs successfully during a certain phase of the moon.
           </p>

           <p dir="ltr">
            On the RPM side, (with dnf5 now deprecated) modularity streams, aim to be a solution to branched or slotted package groups. However it can lead to trading one problem for another, in this case, filtering out RPMs which may be required to satisfy a dependency. That can sometimes be useful, as in the case of the RHEL precompiled kmod packages, is used to both select the appropriate kmod combination to install and to block upgrading to a kernel not yet supported by a kmod package.

            This session will explain how a packet flows in/out of a Linux system. It will explain the fundamentals of how NICs work in Linux and how packets are recieved starting at the packet buffers in the kernel space and ending at the user&#39;s application running in the userspace. It will explain how IRQ handlers, poll list and softIRQs work and the roles of DMA engines in the NICs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The session provides a comprehensive view on the networking on a Linux system and how the network stack is engaged. It will also touch base briefly on pass-through techniques and VFIO driver and the challanges related to small packets. The session aims to assist Linux users and engineers on gaining indepth knowledge of Linux networking and what different options exist for improving performance.

            for 22x I will lead a hands-on workshop where people can learn the basics of Blender and how to use Blender&#39;s

             Blender

            The world of cloud native continues to grow as more organizations consume tools such as Kubernetes, Argo, Flux, etc. With over 210 projects, finding information about them can be a challenge.  Get your hiking boots ready because we are about to traverse the wild, wonderful world of the CNCF Landscape. Why you ask? “Just go to the website” isn’t enough, sometimes you need a guide to show you the ropes. In these introductory sessions we will go over some of the diverse set of projects inside the CNCF so that you’re well equipped to find what you’re looking for.
            <br>
            <br>
            Getting started can be difficult for new users and contributors. We will equip you with knowledge so you can make an informed decision when you’re choosing projects to include in your toolkit. In this talk you will learn how to navigate the CNCF Landscape to find information about our projects. You will learn how to search by category &amp; maturity, and understand how organizations use these projects in production. The goal is for you to be confident in your ability to traverse the landscape so the next time you &#34;go to the website&#34; you will find what you need.

            For many years, firewall solutions on Linux have grown and evolved, without any major change, until eBPF. While eBPF can allow very fast and efficient packet filtering, the learning curve doesn&#39;t make it easily accessible to non-developers.
            <code>
             bpfilter
            </code>
            aims to bridge the gap between existing tools (
            <code>
             nftables
            </code>
            ,
            <code>
             iptables
            </code>
            ) and modern technologies such as eBPF.
           </p>
           <p>
            By translating filtering rules into native code,
            <code>
             bpfilter
            </code>
            abstracts the complexity behind cutting-edge kernel technologies while maintaining backward compatibility with existing solutions. Let&#39;s discuss about
            <code>
             bpfilter

            How do you integrate API Security into your DevSecOps processes? You have DevOps tooling and CI/CD pipelines for your product release cycle. Your Dev &amp; Ops teams work well together. You started a DevSecOps transformation to Shift Left and test code security in pipelines.
            <br>
            <br>
            But how do you integrate the Security teams into DevOps to achieve true DevSecOps? Then, how do you integrate APIs, as they are behavior-based? Traditional AppSec can’t identify vulnerabilities in API consumption.
            <br>
            <br>
            Learn how to integrate API testing into Shift Left DevSecOps pipelines to eliminate vulnerabilities. Learn how to bring Dev, Sec, Ops teams together to improve Mean Time To Remediation, and keep your teams happy!
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Problem:
            <br>
            <br>
            DevOps Releases code to market faster. Traditional release patterns of 1-2x annualyl fails at cloud scale. DevOps tooling and microservices architectures allow for independent releases. DevOps culture grew organically as Dev and Ops teams learned to work harmoniously.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, DevSecOps represents newer thinking with security integration to DevOps processes. Early efforts such as traditional AppSec integrated security to pipelines, which improved code security, but we still see breaches at record levels.
            <br>
            <br>
            Part of the problem is organizational incentives are at cross purposes. Developers are still incentivized to get features to market fast. Ops teams are incentivized for uptime and keeping Dev teams moving. Security teams are incentivized to reduce risk, in opposition to the above objectives. Risk reduction
            <em>
             after
            </em>
            code development and integration slows progress and blocks code release due to late stage vulnerability discovery.
            <br>
            <br>
            Shift left moves discovery earlier, but security teams are already stretched thin. API security is behavior based, not traditional code security discoverable, so how do you add this?
            <br>
            <br>
            The Solution:
            <br>
            <br>
            Shift further left! Integrate Security teams even earlier in the pipeline - catch problems at the design stage. APIs are products that deliver data, and the business problems can be caught at design stage as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tooling:
            <br>
            <br>
            API Scanning tools can integrate to CI/CD pipelines, shifting left into the existing test/build phases. But they require live dev environments to test API behavior, akin to DAST tools.
            <br>
            <br>
            Culture:
            <br>
            <br>
            DevSecOps triad in large orgs are siloed. Form a DevSecOps Center of Excellence as your first steps. Share best practices. Co-host technical trainings. Co-host social events to bring teams together organically. Fix the incentives problem by cross-incentivizing your teams.

            At DEF CON 32, a few friends pushed binary caching on NixOS to its limits. Thanks to a generous hardware donation by Protectli, we managed to get a mesh network of binary cache servers running in our backpacks, with Nebula mesh VPN and 802.11s mesh WiFi running between them using TPMs for key exchange.
           </p>
           <p>
            We see a future where trustworthy software can be built and fetched from nearly anywhere, and every device can be a node in a swarm of Nix binary caches. Follow along as we build a true edge CDN!

            This presentation explores Adversarial Intelligence - an approach that views application security from an attacker’s perspective. Drawing from vulnerability research experience at the NSO Group and building Pegasus, the speaker will highlight how overlooked low and medium vulnerabilities can be combined to execute successful attacks. By examining attack chains and application runtime behavior, attendees will see how gaps often missed by traditional methods are exposed. Attendees will learn about effective tools and techniques for detecting and mitigating these threats, especially in cloud-native and distributed systems. Designed for security practitioners and academics, this session provides a deeper understanding of defending against sophisticated attackers by adopting their mindset.

            Servers are expensive. Servers with GPUs are even more expensive. AI agents rely on servers with GPUs. If you don’t have control over what is happening at different parts of the stack, then things can change out from under you and your AI agent can change drastically without warning. Read: your AI chatbot friend can get massively depressed out of nowhere!
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, I’ll cover all of the parts involved in a production-grade AI agent workload and how and where you can and should get control of them. This will cover the overall stack you’ll end up using, model management and the risks of models changing, cost-time tradeoffs and how to make educated decisions about them, as well as stories of my misadventures when things went wrong. The audience will leave this talk with practical strategies for maintaining control over their AI agent’s behavior and for controlling costs.

            Cybersecurity Analyst burnout is real and stakes are higher than ever as all the data is stored completely digitally and threat actors are always after it. In detection and response, detection is not easily achieved and response is not fast. Chances are high that before an alert hits the SIEM/SOAR, some form of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is already been used by the suite of cyber defense products in the SOC.
           </p>
           <p>
            This presentation digs deeper into using AI Agents to help in the SOC workflow. AI Agents are typically built to do specific tasks. AI Agents are great at automating simple, repetitive tasks. The real challenges of this implementation are beyond the issues seen in GenAI and LLMs like prompt injection, hallucinations, etc. For a pseudo-anonymous AI agent to close or escalate a security event, the organization has to trust the AI Agent platform by allowing access to the logs required to make a decision. AI agents must also be integrated with other infrastructure to take actions like Block IP / scan device / block domain / isolate device/ quarantine file/ password reset / raise a new case, etc. At this stage, human oversight is required for all AI agent actions and these AI models should continuously learn the decision-making logic from the human expertise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Multiple AI Agents must work together to respond to threats at scale and super high speed. One way of achieving potential Autonomous SOC is having multiple agents dedicated to doing one task. One AI Agent (AI Receiver Agent) can be deployed to receive the alert and enrich it so that enough information is present about the user, endpoint, network indicators, and data involved in the alert. This information is now passed to another AI Agent ( AI Hunt Agent) whose function is to combine all the data points hunt for the suspicious indicator in the entire infrastructure and pull that details for enterprise-wide visibility. Lastly, the AI Response Agent decides based on the playbook and remediates the threat.

            As a Cyber Security Practitioner, working as a Sr. Intrusion Analyst and Cybersecurity Researcher, I believe it is required to shed some light on the automation illusion and discuss how AI Agents must be integrated in a compliant way. This involves overcoming challenges of Black Box AI, Trust Issues, Integration with Security Stack, etc.

            The current state of earthquake monitoring systems utilize standard algorithms that process seismic data in realtime, and run software on local servers. Earthquake products such as focal mechanisms, moment tensors, ShakeMaps and waveforms are generated. While this system has proven effective and robust for twenty-plus years, it is a dated system in need of modernization. The Southern California Seismic Network is exploring ways to generate and distribute earthquake products with modern software technologies such as cloud-native services in Amazon Web Services (AWS), serverless computing, containers, and infrastructure as code. AI-powered models are implemented within this monitoring system, as a substitute for standard algorithms.
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            The Southern California Seismic Network has developed a system known as Quakes2AWS. It is a versatile system that uses AWS cloud components and runs machine learning models on both real-time and historical time-series data. In addition, the network has developed a terrestrial, API-based post-processing system to run AI models on historical time-series data. A discussion on both system architectures will touch upon topics including streaming data, latency, Docker containers, databases, and CI/CD.
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Also discussed are the artificial intelligence models used in seismology, for phase picking and for earthquake event association. Many of these models are open-source. The goal is to have these AI models augment humans in analyzing earthquakes, such as finding earthquakes that timers or standard algorithms might miss. From an archival and academic perspective, an alternate catalog can be generated that other researchers might to download.
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            The results of the monitoring system pipeline will be discussed, as it pertains to the AI models’ findings against the earthquake waveform data. The results have shown to be promising, particularly in utilizing the Phasenet neural network and GaMMa associator to spot smaller earthquake events that timers may have missed. The modular design of the pipeline also allows for swapping out models seamlessly. Finally, there will be a discussion on future directions and implications.

            This beginner-friendly session will first introduce the basics of quantum computing and explain why it poses a threat to current public-key algorithms such as RSA, DSA, and ECC. Next, we’ll explore at a high level post-quantum cryptographic algorithms—specifically, lattice-based, hash-based, and code-based encryption schemes—that are being considered as replacements for today’s standards. Participants will learn about open-source libraries and tools that already support post-quantum algorithms, along with their compatibility with widely used Linux services.

            In PostgreSQL, managing schema changes without downtime can be a challenging task. Table-level locks, which control access during Data Definition Language (DDL) operations like
            <code>
             ALTER
            </code>
            or
            <code>
             DROP TABLE
            </code>
            , can result in unintended application slowdowns or even service interruptions when not fully understood. This talk will provide a comprehensive dive into table-level locking and lock queueing in PostgreSQL, helping attendees gain the insights they need to perform efficient schema changes.
           </p>
           <p>
            We’ll start by explaining the various types of table-level locks in PostgreSQL such as Access Share, Exclusive, and Access Exclusive and how they are automatically managed during common DDL operations. Then, we’ll break down lock queuing: how PostgreSQL organizes lock requests, what happens when transactions wait for locks, and how deadlocks can arise in complex environments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next, we’ll focus on practical approaches to managing table-level locks for near-zero downtime. Attendees will learn techniques to minimize locking impact, including understanding lock conflicts, using online schema migration patterns, and identifying lock-heavy queries. We’ll introduce tools like
            <code>
             pgroll
            </code>
            , which utilizes the expand/contract pattern to make schema changes in small, lock-free steps.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end of this session, attendees will be equipped with practical strategies and knowledge to control lock behavior during schema changes, ensuring data integrity and reducing operational disruptions. This talk will provide the tools needed to manage PostgreSQL schema changes with confidence and minimal impact on production environments.

            Modern day APIs sometimes feel like demos for the main product, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way. Developers continue to push boundaries, creating innovative sources of data that inspire creative new projects.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, Addison Hart (
            <a href="https://tgrcode.com/">
             https://tgrcode.com/
            </a>
            ), a hobbyist reverse engineer and data scientist with extensive experience in geospatial, transit, and video game APIs, will share his insights on building quality APIs that can make a real-world impact.
           </p>
           <p>
            His most well-known project is the Public Mario Maker 2 API (
            <a href="https://tgrcode.com/posts/mario_maker_2_api">
             https://tgrcode.com/posts/mario_maker_2_api
            </a>
            ), designed for Nintendo’s custom-content Switch game, Mario Maker 2. With a thriving community of players and developers eager to explore the game on new levels, Addison released this API to encourage creative uses of the game and enhance the competitive scene with a level viewer. His experience building and running this API, along with observing community feedback, has shaped the ideas he presents in this talk.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, this talk sees APIs as the execution of 4 ideas, each of which is integral.
           </p>
           <p>
            1. Latency
            <br>
            Latency is crucial for any application’s user experience, but especially so for APIs aiming to open up new possibilities. APIs that deliver near real-time information enable many more use cases than those that don’t. Addison will cover why latency is essential, share common pitfalls in creating intensive endpoints, and demonstrate ways to address these challenges.
           </p>
           <p>
            2. Quantity
            <br>
            API developers sometimes make the mistake of serving too little or too much data from an endpoint. Addison will discuss how an API must serve 2 different kinds of users, average and advanced, and each of them are important to please. He will discuss how a good API can be &#34;progressively upgraded&#34; to serve both, with neither being impacted. In addition, he will describe solutions seen both in the wild and implemented in successful public APIs as well as performance problems faced by exposing all information possible from an endpoint.
           </p>
           <p>
            3. Coverage
            <br>
            The primary reason APIs sometimes feel like demos for a larger product is that developers fail to include critical endpoints that tie everything together. Addison will explain how missing endpoints lead to frustration for users and limit community-driven tools. He’ll also discuss the importance of &#34;cross-references&#34; in the larger ecosystem and share strategies for responding to feedback on missing endpoints.
           </p>
           <p>
            4. Quality
            <br>
            An API that excels in latency, quantity, and coverage still needs to be easy for developers to use. Addison will discuss best practices for self-documenting APIs, appropriate data formats, and responding proactively to potential user issues. He will also highlight effective documentation strategies to improve the developer experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, Addison will showcase examples of well-executed APIs that have surprising social impact. Expect a talk that will inspire you with the exciting potential that can come from well-designed code!

            Many developers are surprisingly low-tech outside of their jobs. Whether it&#39;s automating daily chores or adding smart detection systems, you already have the skills to make your home truly intelligent.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, we’ll explore 5 demos showing how to elevate your home automation beyond simple convenience, creating a smarter, safer, and more proactive living environment -- like triggering a sequence of actions when indoor air quality is low. By leveraging AI, sensor networks, and popular platforms like Home Assistant, you can transform your home into a responsive and secure haven. Let’s take our work home with us, and make our homes smarter.

            Meet an attacking MySQL honepot which can “Attack the attackers”. In
            <br>
            2023 we have found a CVE (CVE-2023-21980) in MySQL that allows a rogue
            <br>
            MySQL “server” to attack a client connecting to it; attack meaning RCE
            <br>
            on the client side. Since then we were thinking on how to use it for
            <br>
            good. One obvious application is to create a honeypot which will
            <br>
            attack the attackers. In 2024 we have found another RCE in mysqldump
            <br>
            utility (CVE-2024-21096), so we have created a rogue MySQL server and
            <br>
            weaponized it with a chain of 3 vulnerabilities: 1/ arbitrary file
            <br>
            read 2/ RCE from 2023 (CVE-2023- 21980) 3/ the new RCE
            <br>
            (CVE-2024-21096). With this atomic honeypot we were able to discover 2
            <br>
            new attacks against MySQL server. Using arbitrary file read
            <br>
            vulnerability in MySQL we were able to download and analyze the
            <br>
            attackers&#39; code and then execute an “attack against attackers” using a
            <br>
            chain of exploits.
           </p>
           <p>
            DETAILED OUTLINE:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Introduction
            <br>
            a. We will start with the short pre-recorded demo: an attacker
            <br>
            connects to the MySQL honeypot, thinking it is a MySQL server, with
            <br>
            intention to perform an ransomeware attack; we will then get shell
            <br>
            access on the attackers’ box.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Part 1: MySQL background
            <br>
            <br>
            We will first explain the MySQL protocol and how it works to
            <br>
            demonstrate how the “rogue” server can attack unsuspecting MySQL
            <br>
            client.
            <br>
            A demonstration of 2019 and 2023 CVEs (CVE-2023-21980) and explain how
            <br>
            they can be used for the “rogue server” attacking MySQL client, this
            <br>
            includes a pre-recorded demo. This part is for background only, the
            <br>
            details were released last year.
            <br>
            <br>
            A demonstration of the new RCE (CVE-2024-21096) in mysqldump. This is
            <br>
            a newly discovered vulnerability which was recently fixed in MySQL,
            <br>
            includes a pre-recorded demo. This part is new and the details will be
            <br>
            released for the first time.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Part 2: Honeypot
            <br>
            <br>
            Attacking MySQL honeypot: we will then show how we have weaponized 2
            <br>
            RCEs to “attack the attackers” and establish a reverse shell on the
            <br>
            attacker’s system.
            <br>
            <br>
            A pre-recorded full demo will follow
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Conclusion

            Due to their widespread use and the sensitive data they handle, mobile applications are prime targets for attackers. Ensuring secure coding practices protects user information and maintains application integrity. However, consistently enforcing these practices across development teams is a complex challenge, especially in fast-paced environments where speed often competes with security priorities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our solution integrates Danger, a tool for automating custom checks on pull requests (PRs), to enforce secure coding practices. Danger helps establish a “security-first” mindset by embedding security directly into the development workflow and ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed before code reaches production.

            There are some parts of running applications in the cloud that can be very difficult to automate: integrating dependencies, scaling, upgrades, setting up observability. But what if... it could be easy?  In this talk I will show you how you can use the fully free and open source Juju from Canonical to unlock this power for your applications. I will demonstrate how Go, Django, Flask and FastAPI apps can be &#34;charmed&#34; with incredible ease to unlock these benefits.

            This talk details my journey building a home lab using the TuringPi, Talos Linux, and Kubernetes. Attendees will learn what the TuringPi is, how to flash an operating system to its nodes, how to use Talos Linux to deploy and manage Kubernetes, and how to observe it all with OpenTelemetry. We&#39;ll discuss the gotchas of ARM and the TuringPi and what I wish to see released next. All current and future home labbers welcome!

            Hosting a server doesn&#39;t have to cost a ton of money. Normally you&#39;d rent out a tiny portion of a server stack, in some building somewhere, paying per month for a server plan, but that doesn&#39;t have to be the case. Any device with even a little bit of computing power and access to the internet can turn into a server, like that old office desktop sitting around just waiting to be dumped. The goal of this session is to talk about the differences between a LAN and a WAN, how servers themselves work, and ultimately provide the knowledge and tools necessary to make your own home server from scratch.

            In cloud-native environments, application performance often degrades due to contention over shared resources such as CPU caches and memory bandwidth. Current container technologies do not isolate these resources, which compels operators to maintain low utilization by scaling out their deployments.
           </p>
           <p>
            This session will show how memory noisy neighbor degrades application performance, survey strategies used in production by Google and Alibaba Cloud to mitigate such performance interference, and discuss community efforts, highlighting the memory-collector observability project.

            Modern cloud native applications have all the tools necessary to scale to the moon, but the tools alone are not enough. It is crucial to understand how to identify performance bottlenecks and the specific scenarios in which they arise, as well as to develop strategies for resolving them efficiently without requiring extensive time and resources. Effectively leveraging all available resources ensures that applications remain robust, reliable, and high-performing amidst continuous growth and unexpected load spikes. This comprehensive approach directly impacts key areas such as SEO, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, the organization’s bottom line.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the past 3 years I have evaluated the scaling capabilities of various applications.  In this talk I will share my learnings about application performance and help you understand how to take your applications and distributed systems to the next level.  Attendees will learn how to:
           </p>
           <p>
            - Proactively prepare for gradual and abrupt system stress
           </p>
           <p>
            - Assess and confirm their application’s scaling potential
           </p>
           <p>
            - Identify performance bottlenecks
           </p>
           <p>
            - Implement modifications efficiently
           </p>
           <p>
            - Eliminate blind spots in stress testing and scalability validation
           </p>
           <p>
            This talk discusses fairly technical topics, but at a high level.  The primary goal is to help attendees recognize real and potential preformance issues and evaluate the tools and practices which may be used to limit their impact.  Topics discussed in this talk include, but are not limited to, Kubernetes, monitoring, architecture, synchronization bottlenecks, profiling, the Go profiler and execution tracer,

            How many of us heard microservices this microservices that? No matter how cool and useful the new tech stack is, at the end of the day we are responsible for its reliability and it’s up to us to ensure proper observability. Our company is composed of thousands of microservices and while implementing observability for synchronous HTTP requests was relatively straightforward: We leveraged Prometheus metrics and pretty much followed Google&#39;s SRE handbook for implementing SLOs (Service Level Objectives) — we still had about 10% of applications not covered since they are asynchronous in nature. Even though interactions within these pipelines don’t always happen in real time, they play an equally important role in customer satisfaction.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            In this talk, we would like to present how our company implemented SLOs for asynchronous pipelines from start to finish - how to identify relevant key metrics that represent customer experience, how to add them using Prometheus, how to define good and valid events, the formulas we used for burn rate alert thresholds, and cover some successful case studies at the end.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            We are planning to briefly go over types of async pipelines we have at our company and challenges that come with us. Then, we will dive into what components we need to implement a good observability solution and from there go over definitions of SLI (Service Level Indicator), SLO (Service Level Objective), SLA (Service Level Agreement) and how they correlate to customer experience. Further, we will cover Prometheus metric types and how a counter could be used to count errors, while histograms to keep track of latency distributions and how to define Good/Valid events that power SLOs using these custom metrics. Since SLOs need some alerting system, we will expand on burn rate alert thresholds and the formulas we defined for our async use case in contrast to sync use cases covered in Google’s SRE handbook. If we have enough time (based on further dry-runs and presentation prep) we could show some examples from the internal platform we developed for product teams to add SLOs for their applications and how the Good/Valid event queries, recording rules, and alerting rules are created for them automatically. In the end, we’ll wrap up with a (one or more) successful case study, where latency from event producer to event consumer went up from 58.2 sec to 9.8 min and led to an increase to 21K events waiting in the backlog to be processed), best practices and lessons learned.

            As the demand for vector databases and Generative AI continues to rise, integrating vector storage and search capabilities into traditional databases has become increasingly important. This session introduces the *MyVector Plugin*, a project that brings native vector storage and similarity search to MySQL. Unlike PostgreSQL, which offers interfaces for adding new data types and index methods, MySQL lacks such extensibility. However, by utilizing MySQL&#39;s server component plugin and UDF, the *MyVector Plugin* successfully adds a fully functional vector search feature within the existing MySQL + InnoDB infrastructure, eliminating the need for a separate vector database. The session explains the technical aspects of integrating vector support into MySQL, the challenges posed by its architecture, and real-world use cases that showcase the advantages of combining vector search with MySQL&#39;s robust features. Attendees will leave with practical insights on how to add vector search capabilities to their MySQL systems.

            The shift from traditional virtualization platforms like VMware and oVirt to a cloud-native approach using KubeVirt marks a significant evolution in infrastructure management. In this session, we&#39;ll explore why KubeVirt offers a more future-proof and scalable option for organizations seeking to modernize their infrastructure. We&#39;ll dive deep into the benefits of moving away from legacy systems, how KubeVirt enables seamless integration of virtual machines into Kubernetes, and what this means for managing hybrid workloads. Attendees will gain practical insights into the advantages of unifying their compute strategy under Kubernetes, including easier automation, improved resource efficiency, and better alignment with cloud-native practices.

            The SSPL license introduced by MongoDB in 2018 makes it difficult for developers to use the NoSQL database they love most for projects they are working on.
           </p>
           <p>
            FerretDB allows you to use all tools, drivers, UIs, and the same query language as MongoDB and stay open-source. Our mission is to enable the open-source community and developers to reap the benefits of easy-to-use document databases while avoiding vendor lock-in and faux pen licenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            FerretDB may use PostgreSQL and SQLite as a backend and is designed to work in Kubernetes environments. Everything is to provide developers and operations the flexibility they need to create modern applications and maintain the infrastructure. Because of that, FerretDB becomes a drop-in replacement for MongoDB in many cases.

            Per-CPU variables are widely used in the Linux kernel to reduce contention of atomics and locks in large scale systems. This makes them an attractive API to use from Rust, but exposing this API requires interacting with all levels of the kernel stack: from the build system and linker all the way to arch-specific optimizations and runtime allocation of new per-CPU variables. This talk is intended for an audience that is broadly familiar with kernel primatives and synchronization issues but entirely new to Rust.

            As Linux users, we often install Linux for friends and family, but many struggle with updates, packaging quirks, and system maintenance—leaving you to fix issues and them frustrated. Instead of simply suggesting they get a Chromebook, what if we could create a similar experience with NixOS? My Nixbook project delivers automatic updates, easy Flatpak app installs, and sane defaults for everyday users. In this talk, I’ll share how I built it and made it work flawlessly.

            Public universities, like the University of California, are the source of amazing innovation and discovery. The UC-system has ten campuses, five medical centers, and three affiliated national laboratories.  Researchers in the UC system develop an average of five inventions per day. UC campuses also have significant expertise in developing open source technologies and ecosystems. Open has long been a theme for the UC system from open data to open access to open education, with reproducibility and transparency in research receiving increased recognition in the wake of multiple US government efforts advancing open and equitable research. In an effort to enable UC campuses and their affiliated researchers to expand their impact on the broader community, a UC network of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) was formed in the Spring of 2024. As with OSPOs in industry, academic OSPOs aim to be a center of gravity for the open source work of their organizations. The UC network’s goal  mirrors University of California’s mission to provide “long-term societal benefits through transmitting advanced knowledge, discovering new knowledge.” The six partnering campuses – Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz – are working  to increase the impact of research and education undertaken throughout the system by leveraging open source projects and communities. The UC OSPO Network effort – which is funded through a grant by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation – looks to institutionalize this approach throughout the UC system and create a model for other large public university systems to follow. In this session, presenters from UC Santa Cruz and UCLA will discuss  their work so far and explore how the campus OSPOs can better integrate campus-driven innovation and learning into surrounding  communities. This session will also address how universities can contribute back to open source communities – particularly through the support and training of new contributors and research that strengthens current best practices and sustainability efforts of existing open source projects.

            Each open source community is different and therefore requires different metrics for data-driven decisions about building and supporting it. What makes it so tricky is that everyone pays attention to different aspects of communities. In this talk, we will explore what metrics are available to look at communities and to track the impact of changes we make as we build and support them.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            We will look at real-world examples of how metrics have been used to build and support open source communities. This is based on conversations in the CHAOSS Project, an open source community that defined metrics and developed software to get these metrics. This talk will share what we have learned in the CHAOSS Project about having metrics for open source communities. Once the right metrics have been decided on, both technical and organizational challenges need to be overcome, which we discuss how to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, we will take a look at metrics from the OpenInfra communities and have an open conversation with the audience about what we’re seeing. We will field questions live and dive into the data together.

            The Information Revolution revolutionized many aspects of modern life, with radical social change in addition to technological advancements.  The mass introduction of open-access communications platforms across the Internet has made building and mobilizing social capital more critical than ever for connected digital citizens.  Digital leadership, with the ability to connect and network with other users, has become a key part of our digital activity, and an ability accessible to all users.  Focusing on the Discord platform, this presentation explains the effectiveness of its features in making community building and social capital accessible for users.  As seen from current developments and trends, online communities are the future, both in utility and popularity, and going from just a user to a leader on these platforms is becoming increasingly important and valuable.  Join Alex Moral to learn more about key principles and his expertise in building social capital and social infrastructure, in becoming a digital leader on these platforms, and starting a community from scratch.

            With explosive growth of data and micro services, Observability has become expensive, complicated, and slow. This talks explores why it&#39;s expensive and has become hard to debug issues quickly.
           </p>
           <p>
            This talk explores both the legacy and state of the art approaches to handle cost, and performance in observability systems. It also explains why this is complicated to get it right, why people end up choosing one over the other. Finally, explores with all the recent innovations, if we can achieve both fast and cheap observability.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will touch below topics:
           </p>
           <p>
            - explore various alternatve approaches
           </p>
           <p>
            - why it&#39;s complicated to get both right?
           </p>
           <p>
            - what were pros and cons of various previous attempts?
           </p>
           <p>
            - why is it possible to solve the problem now?
           </p>
           <p>
            - Are there any innovations and learnings we can borrow from other fields like data warehousing and data streaming?

            In open source communities, candidate experience during recruitment holds unique value. A positive candidate experience not only strengthens a company&#39;s reputation but also cultivates a network of community advocates, referrals, and even future hires among those who were not initially selected. This talk is designed for hiring managers, interviewers, and hiring teams who want to transform their approach to candidate experience, using strategies tailored to the distinctive culture and demands of open source environments.

              The Business Benefits of a Positive Candidate Experience
              <br>
              Open source companies rely heavily on reputation and community, and candidate experience is central to fostering both. We’ll discuss how an optimized candidate journey impacts immediate hiring outcomes and long-term brand reputation. Practical examples will demonstrate how a solid candidate experience attracts return candidates and fuels organic advocacy within the open source community.

              Often, internal HR and company policies are developed with the employee in mind, but these same policies also shape candidate experience. This section will explore how vague role definitions, unclear leveling, and ambiguous responsibilities can leave candidates confused or deterred. We’ll discuss practical ways to align internal policies with recruitment goals, creating clarity and consistency in job descriptions, role responsibilities, and candidate communications.

            How does a small team of systems engineers support the infrastructure of one of the largest global EdTech companies? Welcome to the world of CattleSpa, where we turn infrastructure chaos into zen-like efficiency. This is centered around MySQL and MongoDB, but can be applied to the whole stack.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            I&#39;ll cover how we transformed routine server maintenance into an automated wellness retreat for our systems (hence the name CattleSpa!).
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            I&#39;ll walk you through our real-world implementation with code examples, showing how we:
           </p>
           <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li1">
             Built a flexible automation framework that adapts to new technologies
            </li>
            <li class="li1">
             Created a sustainable way for a small team to manage enterprise-scale infrastructure
            </li>
            <li class="li1">
             Turned &#34;those #@$% servers&#34; into well-behaved, predictable systems
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="p1">
            Whether you&#39;re part of a growing startup or a seasoned cloud engineer, you&#39;ll walk away with practical insights and battle-tested strategies for scaling your infrastructure management without scaling your team.

            Ceph is an open source distributed object store, network block device, and file system designed for reliability, performance, and scalability. It runs on commodity hardware, has no single point of failure, and is supported in the Linux kernel.
            <br>
            <br>
            This tutorial will describe the Ceph architecture, share its design principles, and discuss how it can be part of a cost-effective, reliable cloud stack.
            <br>
            <br>
            The de-facto standard for OpenStack storage, Ceph is leading the rising tide of Software-defined-Storage and a top contender in the Kubernetes and S3 storage use cases.

            This talk presents an overview of integration strategies between CephFS and OpenStack Manila, tracing the development and synergies between Ceph’s distributed file system and OpenStack’s file share service. We’ll share reasons why CephFS has emerged as the most popular cloud file sharing option with OpenStack Manila. Through the history, you’ll see how this integration has evolved to meet the demanding needs of large-scale cloud environments.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll review the key features that set CephFS apart, from its scalable architecture to features that support various application types and workloads. Not all CephFS options are equal—choosing the right access protocol can have significant impacts on system performance, scalability, and security. We’ll discuss the advantages and limitations of using CephFS Native, which offers close-to-the-metal performance but may introduce complexities and dependencies unsuited for some cloud infrastructures. We’ll then explore CephFS NFS, a more universally compatible solution, but with its own performance and scalability trade-offs. This comparison will help participants identify the scenarios where each approach shines—and where they might introduce challenges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, we’ll explore the future roadmap of CephFS in OpenStack Manila. Features like the SMB/CIFS driver and VirtIOFS are on the horizon, each promising to unlock new potential. The SMB driver brings compatibility with Windows environments, broadening CephFS’s use cases, while VirtIOFS introduces high-performance file sharing for VMs and containers. Both of these developments are expected to expand the versatility of OpenStack Manila, particularly in hybrid and multi-platform clouds.
           </p>
           <p>
            This session will be valuable to OpenStack operators, developers, and anyone interested in the technical and strategic choices around cloud file sharing. Join us to discuss the present and future of CephFS and OpenStack Manila, and discover the potential for these technologies to transform your infrastructure.

            The worlds of Cloud Computing and High-Performance Computing (HPC) are rapidly converging with the rise of AI and complex scientific workloads; however, many HPC users and system administrators are experiencing the limitations of classical HPC systems. Traditional HPC workload schedulers, like Slurm and OpenPBS, are excellent choices for running short-term batch jobs on multi-tenant compute nodes, but they are not good for running indefinite services such as data warehouses and inference servers. Modern HPC systems need to become more cloud-like where they are able to support running both short-term workloads and indefinite services, be elastic with their resource usage, and autonomize common lifecycle operations.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            OpenStack and Kubernetes are great platforms for building these modern HPC systems, but there&#39;s one problem: the limitations of your system operations team.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            The user experience for deploying and managing an HPC system is often overlooked. It is already hard enough to build and deploy a classical HPC system, and now you are adding the additional complexity of deploying two new layers. One layer for OpenStack and another layer on top of OpenStack that contains both the core services of the HPC cluster and the Kubernetes cluster for hosting indefinite services. This architectural complexity can quickly bog down any experienced team, but it doesn’t have to be this way.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            In this talk, you will learn how to use Sunbeam – a cloud-native OpenStack powered by Kubernetes – and Charmed HPC to streamline the deployment and management of modern HPC clusters. You will learn how to use Sunbeam to set up OpenStack, and then you will learn how to deploy your HPC system on top of OpenStack using Charmed HPC. Lastly, you will learn how to set up Kubernetes next to your HPC system to provide cluster services such as identity management and observability metrics. Setting up a modern HPC system does not need to be a dark and stormy process - it can be as clear as day with Sunbeam!

            The adoption of open source software is on the rise across all industries, but what &#39;open source&#39; means (even if they use the right licenses) is getting muddier and muddier. It can be hard to know for sure whether your efforts will benefit a corporation, a community, or both.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this talk you will get a crash course on open source licensing, the differences and similarities in open source projects depending on who&#39;s funding it, the different ways you can engage with the types of projects, and how to decide what type of project you want to work on.

            Earth System Models (ESMs) are physical models that allow scientists to understand the progression of our planet’s climate on seasonal to decadal timescales, which is becoming increasingly relevant with the rapid progression of climate change. Many existing ESMs are developed based on legacy codes dating back to the 1970s, require hundreds to thousands of CPUs to run, and are not readily available to the public. The Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA) is developing an open source ESM from scratch with the intention of providing the wider community with access to a model that is less computationally intensive while still maintaining scientific accuracy. CliMA’s model will provide a framework within which scientists can easily iterate on existing science to test out novel theories. This talk will give an overview of the CliMA software ecosystem and demonstrate the benefits afforded to the scientific community by making such a project open source.

            Many organizations have embraced the cloud for deploying software, but they still rely on local machines for development. Isn’t it time to bring development into the cloud too? Many are still building work-alikes on their laptops, or using shadow IT when local resources become a constraint. Deploying a Cloud Development Environment (CDE) that is secure, stable, scalable, and loved by developers is no longer a luxury—it&#39;s a necessity. This talk presents the process behind deploying a robust CDE that becomes a competitive advantage for your organization.

           <p dir="ltr">
            Attendees will learn how to leverage cloud-native technologies to build scalable CDEs that maintain both performance and developer experience. This talk will focus on:

            In the face of ever-growing data volumes and the increasing complexity of modern applications, cloud native technologies are emerging as the cornerstone of next-generation database systems.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2023, Divine joined Severalnines, a company that builds database automation and management software used by hundreds of organizations. Coming from a background of cloud native technologies like Kubernetes and Cilium, Divine joined Severalnines in their journey building cloud native database software for cloud service providers and enterprise organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, Divine will explore the multifaceted (many sides) role of cloud native technologies in shaping modern database systems. Divine will delve into the specifics of how Kubernetes Operators, Container Storage Interfaces (CSI), APIs, etc., are transforming the way databases are built, deployed, and managed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Towards the end, Divine will discuss the benefits these technologies bring, such as enhanced scalability, resilience, agility, and automation, highlighting case studies of organizations across the Data on Kubernetes (DoK) community.
           </p>
           <p>
            This presentation is designed for database administrators, software engineers, DevOps professionals, and anyone interested in the intersection of cloud-native technologies and database systems.

            The last generation of startups were all born and grew up in the Cloud. They’ve build successful businesses on top of Someone Else’s Platform, and have hit a limit to their growth. They’ve watched their costs and risks grow linearly as their customers grow linearly, and are looking for economies of scale to power their next phase. Cost, performance, security, compliance, control and right-sized scope all push to a future of a blended hybrid on-prem and cloud. One where a stable production environment handles a base load, while experiments and short-lived projects can be brought up and down on demand. The expertise to do this has atrophied in Cloud-only shops. Repatriating production loads from cloud back to self-hosted is a lost art for some. But the progress of the past few years has been to formalize Infrastructure As Code, so we now have mature technologies to allow automation of deployment across a wide variety of platforms, with shops able to pick-and-choose their preferred level of specialization. So Cloud-only can become Cloud-some or even Cloud-most, or anywhere inbetween. Everything old is new again, and the old-timers in the audience will recognize another turn of the Performance Wheel, where companies outsource to reduce costs and try to maintain quality, and once business needs shift and outsourcing becomes bloated, then insource to address new needs and lower costs. And repeat. Hybrid solutions never really went away, and are going to come back in earnest over the next year as Cloud-native companies continue to expand and look for economies of scale. This Cloud Repatriation will continue to trend with robust open source alternatives (like OpenStack) leading the way, and a whole ecosystem of vendors to allow customization at all levels of the serving stack.

            We went from running databases in a typical LAMP stack, to building databases to run in cloud like environments, to actually just running database in the hosted cloud (or a self-run hosted platform like Kubernetes). The principles of running your data stores, however, have not changed, and still require: monitoring, instrumentation, management, compliance, high availability, optimised performance, security, capacity planning, and keeping up with the SLAs.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            With the advent of being cloud native, maybe in the hosted cloud or via Kubernetes, with a bit of DevOps thrown in, how does doing it the CloudOps way, help change the task of the Database Administrator (DBA)?

            We&#39;ll cover the MySQL family (MySQL, MariaDB, Percona Server) and PostgreSQL, the Amazon RDS family (RDS for MySQL / PostgreSQL, but also, Aurora), Google Cloud SQL, Oracle Cloud, Azure SQL, Vitess (PlaneScale), and roll your own Kubernetes based solutions. There will also be a smidge of MongoDB (and managing other kinds of data stores). We&#39;ll focus on:
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            * different backup strategies (or do you even need one?)
           </p>
           <p>
            * planning for multiple data centres (or availability zones) for High Availability
           </p>
           <p>
            * where the application is hosted
           </p>
           <p>
            * do you need proxies
           </p>
           <p>
            * how do you get the most performance?
           </p>
           <p>
            * what it all should cost?
           </p>
           <p>
            * monitoring
           </p>
           <p>
            * security
           </p>
           <p>
            * cross-cloud databases (aka, hybrid cloud)
           </p>
           <p>
            * is ML/AI going to change, aka, automate this?

            Come to this talk to learn how the DBA task changes, or how Dev can also be closer to Ops when it comes to data stores.

            The ability to retain, understand, and act on personal data is key to building truly intelligent assistants. In this talk, Liam Broza introduces Companion Intelligence, a platform that leverages Digital Memory to give users control over their data while enabling AI-powered deep personalization and contextual awareness. He will explore the evolution of Companion Intelligence, its role in shaping embodied AI agents, and provide a demo of how these systems can enhance productivity, security, and autonomy in the digital world.

            You probably have an iPhone or Android phone. You also probably take a gazillion pictures. Well what do all those pictures say about you or the world you live in? In this session I will show you how to use computer vision data curation to understand: are there themes in your pictures, which pictures are out of focus, which has your pet versus a QR code?

            Come to have fun looking at patterns in your photos. Or you are a photographer and want to learn these techniques to run on your other photos. Or, maybe, just maybe, you can peer  into the deepest depths of your psyche revealed by phone photos. Then again, maybe just come to learn some of the latest AI Computer Vision techniques by using photos you can relate to.

            Come along on this ADHD-fueled journey as Jeremy tells _some_ of his journey in tech, all while trying to stay on topic. He’ll dive into some of his early days “hunting squirrels” while also keeping the local librarians employed. He’ll also touch on his experiences through the early days of the internet (not ARPANET, but the “world wide web”) and how he learned to “cope” with this thing called ADHD, without _really_ coping with it, until he had to. You’ll hopefully laugh, probably cry, and that will just be from having to listen to him try to stay on topic, while also hopefully gaining a better feeling of how it’s ok to ask for help, and to also occasionally experiment with new ideas and being open about your journey through life.

            Flakes are a way to share Nix artifacts in a reproducible, composable and discoverable way. A major limitation of flakes right now is that they are not *configurable*: there is no easy way to pass arguments to a flake from the command line. In this talk, I describe an extension of flake schemas that make flakes configurable in a way that preserves discoverability, hermetic evaluation and evaluation caching. This addresses a major blocker in the adoption of flakes.

            It started with a product listing for a four-wheeled device that looked like a fun weekend project. But: projects like this are never really that simple.

           <p>
            Before long, upgrades made our robot aware of its environment and much more fun to control.

            In this talk, attendees can expect to learn the abbreviated version of everything we learned
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            to do when it comes to building and controlling remotely operated vehicles. We&#39;ll dive into the hardware side of things, talk about protocol-driven development, why memory and garbage collection are crucial and how we made all parts work together, reliably.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether you&#39;re a hardware or software engineer, this talk has something for everyone: entertaining anecdotes combined with real-world learnings.

            Since 1987, Copyleft licensing has been the primary strategy of the FOSS community to guarantee users&#39; rights to copy, share, modify, redistribute, and reinstall modified versions of their software.   In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we&#39;d sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reality check that we&#39;ve received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue.  While this talk will cover the few huge successes in copyleft enforcement that have lead to real improvements to the rights and freedoms of users, we&#39;ll also face frankly the compromises made and false paths taken in the earliest days, that have now led to a simple but unfortunate fact: almost every Linux-based device for sale on the market today does *not* comply with Linux&#39;s license (the GPLv2).
           </p>
           <p>
            This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work in practice, how we wished it had worked, and discuss ideas, suggestions, and plans for the future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom and rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever wondered how FOSS was
            <em>
             actually
            </em>
            was supposed
            <em>
             stay
            </em>
            FOSS for the long term?  Have you ever been unsure or confused why — in a world where Linux is on nearly every device —  most people cannot actually run an alternative OS build on their device?

            At ClickHouse, we recently changed the way we orchestrate databases provisioned by customers, specifically the way we use statefulsets. This was done through a painstaking refactoring of our operator. There was just one big problem: we wanted to migrate our legacy fleet of thousands of services from the old orchestration code-path to the new one without any downtime - even the queries should continue to run as they are. If there is one thing that people hate doing - it is migrations. They are painful, have lots of corner cases, and take a long time. In our case, it took us almost 6 months to migrate the entire fleet. But we encountered lots of interesting challenges along the way. This talk will walk you through these challenges of live migrating the entire ClickHouse Cloud Fleet&#39;s orchestration while continuing to serve customer queries and ingest. The story involves our Operator, deep-dive into StatefulSets, a custom migration controller, semaphores, building a maintenance mode for the cloud product, durable execution workflows, and many, many database synchronization challenges.

            darktable is often criticized for having too many functions or being too complex, but the basics are surprisingly easy once you know where to look!
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll start off with the basics for those new to darktable:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.Importing images from your camera
           </p>
           <p>
            2. Culling and sorting
           </p>
           <p>
            3. Keywording and management
           </p>
           <p>
            Then we&#39;ll move into achieving a basic edit in as little time as possible, using as few modules as possible. With an emphasis on speed, we&#39;ll show how you can process your whole shoot expidently.
           </p>
           <p>
            After we&#39;ve covered a basic edit, we&#39;ll move on to more advanced techniques, such as masking and color grading.
           </p>
           <p>
            If time permits, we&#39;ll have a Q&amp;A to address specific attendee issues and concerns.
           </p>

            Are you looking to break into the thrilling world of cyber and physical security? Curious about how data breaches impact everyday folks and interested in helping organizations recover and minimize the impact of attacks? Join us for an eye-opening discussion that pulls back the curtain on data breaches, corporate cover-ups, and the harsh realities that aspiring security professionals face in today’s digital landscape.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this session, I will share my experiences as a private security researcher tracking cybercriminals and ransomware gangs, striving to support victims and help organizations enhance their defenses. We’ll explore how organizations often prioritize profit and reputation over transparency, choosing to ignore vulnerabilities and brush breaches under the rug.
           </p>
           <p>
            You’ll hear compelling stories, including the controversial case of the City of Columbus, which sued a researcher for exposing the impact of a ransomware attack. This illustrates a troubling trend: individuals trying to help organizations often face rejection or suspicion, as companies prefer to forget what happened rather than confront the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exploring the Psychological Dynamics We’ll examine the psychology behind organizational responses when ethical hackers or researchers approach them with critical findings. Instead of viewing these individuals as allies, organizations frequently see them as threats. This mindset stems from a desire to avoid negative publicity and the belief that acknowledging a breach could lead to financial repercussions.
           </p>
           <p>
            When ethical hackers reveal vulnerabilities, many organizations may react defensively, opting to silence or dismiss these voices rather than engage with the uncomfortable reality of their security posture. This culture of avoidance hampers necessary improvements and puts organizations and their customers at greater risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who’s Leading the Incident Response? A crucial element of this discussion is understanding who leads incident response efforts. Often, C-suite executives, including CEOs and COOs, take charge of public communications following a breach, sometimes sidelining the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and their expertise. This can result in inadequate messaging that fails to address root issues and may inadvertently exacerbate the organization’s problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Role of Incident Response and Third-Party Assessment We’ll discuss the essential role of incident response and the challenges faced by individuals who wish to assist organizations during crises. When approached for help, many organizations turn away the very experts who could guide them through remediation and recovery. Their desire to move on quickly often leads to overlooking critical lessons learned from breaches, perpetuating a cycle of vulnerability.
           </p>
           <p>
            Engaging third-party experts for independent assessments can provide an objective view of the breach’s impact, revealing potential damage and risks that organizations may underestimate. This helps bridge the communication gap between the organization and the public, fostering a culture of accountability and transparency that is crucial for maintaining trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reaching Out to Victims We will highlight the importance of engaging with victims of cyberattacks. Organizations often dismiss the experiences of those affected, believing that confronting past breaches is unnecessary or too costly. However, these insights can offer invaluable guidance for improving security measures and fostering a culture of accountability. By neglecting these conversations, organizations miss critical opportunities to strengthen their defenses and protect their stakeholders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Join us as we uncover these complex dynamics and discuss how aspiring security professionals can navigate the challenging landscape of corporate cybersecurity. Together, we aim to foster a better understanding of the ethical hacker’s role and encourage a more open, collaborative approach to cybersecurity improvements.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don’t Miss Out! Come ready to learn, share, and engage in thought-provoking conversations about the realities of data breaches and the ethical responsibilities of security professionals. Let’s work together to uncover the truth and safeguard our future in cybersecurity!

            (Commercial Real Estate Exchange Inc.) is a digital marketplace and platform designed to streamline commercial real estate transactions. They allow brokers to manage the entire process from listing to closing on one platform, including digital letters of intent, best and final offer negotiations, and transaction management tools. Their data and research features, too, allow investors and other commercial real estate stakeholders to conduct due diligence and proactively connect with other professionals ahead of the transaction process.
           </p>
           <p>
            At Crexi, we have developed a versatile framework to deploy open source models, like
            <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/layoutlm">
             LayoutLM
            </a>
            at scale.  We developed this tooling because we did not find any available, easy to deploy system, that enabled us to manage, monitor, and maintain open source models on our own infrastructure.  This tooling enables our pipeline iteration through DevOps principles and tools like Infrastructure as Code (IaC), gitops automation and observability of pipelines for ML Ops. We do this with a modular design that allows quick connection points for new or evolving models with a variety of dependency and integration requirements.
           </p>
           <p>
            The modular components are configured and instantiated using
            <a href="https://www.pulumi.com">
             Pulumi
            </a>
            &#39;s IAC product, an open-source SDK with a variety of backend language support and resource providers.  For our solution, we used typescript on self-hosted storage, managing primarily AWS resources.
           </p>
           <p>
            The observability piece of the solution leverages the Open Telemetry connector to Datadog.  Any OTel solution would work, but we happened to be using datadog already to bring together data from the component services to provide a unified view of the deployed pipelines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, the operational paradigm for the Crexi framework is that the Data Scientist supplies a YAML configuration file through gitops to call the Pulumi stack activity.  This enables Continual Integration and Deployment opportunities which lessen the need for operational resources, keeps the infrastructure reproducible, and hardened against code regression.
           </p>
           <p>
            This presentation covers a short intro of the presenter and the company, acknowledgements of the authors and contributors to the solution, an overview of the modular design, the project requirements and their relevance to the project design, a technical deep dive into the components, and a walkthrough of an example pipeline deployment, as well as some illustrations of the dashboards and workflows.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ML pipeline deployment framework explored here offers a powerful, scalable, adaptable, and robust solution for Data Scientists and meets Crexi&#39;s needs for hassle-free model deployment and pipeline management.  With the power to rapidly build and deploy pipelines, the team cultivates a greater focus on model experimentation and testing new ML techniques and technologies.  By leveraging commonly available services, it facilitates easy integration with other 3rd party services, including data warehouses to house the data which then serve, in a virtuous cycle, as a deep reserve for training new models which can subsequently be easily deployed with new ML pipelines.  This cycle of improvement and innovation then becomes the engine that propels Crexi&#39;s projects forward.

            Nix can be daunting to learn!
            <br>
            There are so many ways to hold it -- what can we do as software teams to wield it and become productive in our container environments?
            <br>
            <br>
            In this workshop, Leigh, Tanja, and Nick will show a Nix GitOps workflow for both your team&#39;s laptops and Kubernetes clusters.
            <br>
            <br>
            We&#39;ll cover the basics of Nix and teach about Flox, a collaborative and approachable interface for using Nix as a team.
            <br>
            <br>
            The development workflows made possible by Nix and the ops workflows pioneered by both Nix and GitOps on Kubernetes extend the story of repeatability further left than ever before.
            <br>
            <br>
            Attendees will work together in the hands-on portion to:
           </p>
           <p>
            - bootstrap a frontend and backend project with Javascript, Go, and Postgres
           </p>
           <p>
            - declare cross-platform tools and dependencies for build and development
           </p>
           <p>
            - containerize their build in a Nix-native way
           </p>
           <p>
            - use GitOps via Flux (not Flox) to promote their service to Kubernetes clusters with zero-downtime deploys
            <br>
            <br>
            Shifting packaging discipline to the left in our team workflows and making it collaborative and cross-platform opens up new maintenance possibilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll close the session discussing:
           </p>
           <p>
            - Continuous Builds
           </p>
           <p>
            - Patching
           </p>
           <p>
            - Reproducibility and Caching
            <br>
            <br>
            Teams can save hours of debugging each sprint just by declaring their local dependencies with Nix within the same lifecycle as their code.
            <br>
            This has a notable symmetry to the benefits of GitOps in cloud-native operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Expect to leave this workshop with the confidence to harmonize Nix with Kubernetes and change the way you (and your teams) work.

            Platform Engineering and DevOps leaders must move beyond traditional technical and productivity metrics to ensure lasting success. Developer Experience (DevEx) is no longer a luxury—it&#39;s a critical business factor that directly influences developer retention, minimizes bottlenecks, speeds up time to market, and leads to superior business outcomes, including higher revenue.
            <br>
            <br>
            Attendees will learn how to effectively communicate the value of DevEx in business value to gain internal buy-in from leadership and stakeholders, even those without a technical background.

            Digital citizen participation is gaining momentum, and open-source software plays a crucial role. This presentation delves into one of the world&#39;s leading open-source platforms for citizen participation, Consul Democracy. We will discuss which tools are appropriate for various projects and how digital participation can be integrated with other tools such as citizen assemblies. While focusing on practical examples, we will primarily explore the meta-level factors necessary for successful citizen participation projects that ensure broad, representative, and high-quality participation. We will also highlight the benefits of open source for governments, extending beyond technical development.

            Kubernetes means containers - but container images stop scaling once you hit 25+ GB, even if you’re building them with Nix. Learn how Anthropic took production startup times from minutes to sub-second with a multi-level, replicated cache hierarchy. We’ll deep dive into nix-sidecar: our custom tool to escape Docker, replacing slow image pulls with highly-parallel native Nix fetches, cached on every node. This talk is for anyone interested in faster deploys or advanced Nix usage!

            This is day one of a two day class on embedded programming. Pre-registration (in addition to your your conference registration) is required.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will be programming a STM Arm chip with no operating system. This will be bare metal programming. For the class we will be using a NUCLEO-F030R6 board which contains the STM Chip, a USB/Serial interface, flash programmer, and debugger. In other words a development system on a board.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first hour will be an overview of the class and getting the hardware setup.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the second hour we will cover what the compiler does behind the scenes. What the output of the pre-processor looks like and what assembly language is.
           </p>
           <p>
            During this lesson we will discover an interesting fact. The program:
           </p>
           <p>
            #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            int main() {
           </p>
           <p>
            printf(&#34;Hello world!\n&#34;);
           </p>
           <p>
            return(0);
           </p>
           <p>
            }
           </p>
           <p>
            does not call &#34;printf&#34;. The compiler optimizes it so that printf is silently replaced with puts.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest of the class discusses the basics of embedded programming. For example, we blink the led. That&#39;s the &#34;Hello World&#34; of embedded system.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will be doing I/O using the serial port and writing directly to the device.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will continue with advanced concepts including interrupts and advanced linker usage on day two.
           </p>

            In an era where the job market is constantly evolving, accurately classifying occupations is essential for understanding labor trends, informing policy decisions, and guiding workforce development. The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system plays a vital role in organizing job data, which informs policy decisions, supports workforce development, and aids businesses and job seekers alike. However, the complexity and diversity of modern job descriptions make assigning the correct SOC codes a significant challenge.
            <br>
            This talk explores how open-source artificial intelligence tools—specifically PyTorch and models from HuggingFace—can significantly improve the accuracy of SOC code predictions from job descriptions. By harnessing these accessible and community-driven resources, we&#39;ve developed innovative methods to better interpret and classify unstructured job data.
            <br>
            Attendees will gain insights into:
            <br>
            - The critical role of accurate SOC classification in understanding labor market trends and supporting economic research.
            <br>
            - Challenges in processing complex and varied job descriptions, and how open-source AI tools can overcome them.
            <br>
            - Practical applications of PyTorch and Hugging Face models in building advanced natural language processing solutions for occupational classification.
            <br>
            By demonstrating the power and potential of open-source AI in real-world problems, this session aims to inspire participants to use these tools in their own projects. We&#39;ll share our experiences and methodologies, highlighting how collaborative efforts and open-source technologies can address real-world challenges effectively.

            Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents unique challenges in emotional expression, communication, and anxiety management. Traditional therapy settings often fail to accommodate the sensory sensitivities and communication barriers that many individuals with autism experience. For this population, music therapy offers a promising alternative. As a non-verbal and immersive therapeutic method, it can enhance emotional expression, foster communication, and promote social interaction. However, despite its proven benefits, professional music therapy is often inaccessible due to financial, geographic, or institutional limitations. These barriers leave many families unable to provide their loved ones with the resources needed to thrive. Euphony Echo was created to address this gap by leveraging technology to bring the transformative power of music therapy directly to those who need it most.

            Euphony Echo is an innovative app that combines Virtual Reality (VR) and real-time audio analysis to offer a safe, engaging platform for individuals with autism to explore music, express emotions, and build confidence. By mimicking key elements of a live music therapy session, the app provides an immersive and interactive experience tailored to the needs of its users. The journey begins in a backstage VR environment, where users can explore, set preferences, and acclimate themselves to the virtual world. This feature ensures that the experience is both safe and personalized, reducing sensory overwhelm and promoting engagement. Once ready, users step onto a virtual stage where they can perform their chosen song in a judgment-free space. This innovative approach empowers users to confront and overcome anxiety while building confidence in their expressive abilities.
            <br>
            At the heart of Euphony Echo lies its advanced Vocal Engine, which provides real-time feedback to guide users toward improved vocal performance. As the app captures audio input, it analyzes pitch accuracy and provides immediate visual feedback through a real-time score and a progress tracker. This structured feedback system motivates users to stay engaged while reinforcing positive behaviors.

            I worked at GoTo.com/Overture/Yahoo in Pasadena 24 years ago, we were doing Big Data when it was called just data.  Information Retrieval used all the sexy ML/LLM/AI concepts you hear about now.  I&#39;ll discuss the parallels and extrapolate on what&#39;s next for LLM, based on what happened with Search.

            is a simple DSL/tracing-tool for writing BPF programs. It abstracts away a lot of the complicated user and kernel space code neccessary to write observability and debugging programs. However, adding new language features/syntax isn&#39;t easy. There are a lot of considerations to be made in regards to bpftrace&#39;s primary usecases and the classic problem of how much complexity/details to hide from the user. This talk will explore some recent case studies (e.g. adding &#34;let&#34;) and discuss some of the challenges of evolving this DSL.

            As the adoption of Kubernetes (k8s) continues to grow in the industry, migrating well-established research workloads to this container orchestration platform poses unique challenges. At Meta, our Cloud Infra team embarked on a journey to transition our Slurm based AI research infrastructure to k8s while maintaining a seamless experience for researchers. In this talk, we will delve into the problems we encountered and the innovative solutions we developed to overcome them.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the primary concerns was ensuring that researchers could continue working without needing to learn new tools or worrying about the underlying infrastructure. We achieved this by creating a custom interface that abstracts away the complexity of k8s interactions. Additionally, we had to address issues related to provisioning, authentication, and access control, which required us to develop novel solutions that integrate with the k8s ecosystem.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also had to rethink how we manage resources such as login nodes, data volumes, and network traffic. By leveraging k8s features and a combination of open source and custom components, we were able to provide flexible and scalable infrastructure that meets the needs of our researchers.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, one of the most significant challenges we faced was adapting to a world without traditional configuration management tools like Chef or Ansible. To manage our hosts, we had to rely on Helm and DaemonSets, which required us to rethink our approach to dynamic configuration changes. Common systemd patterns became s6 configuration running in containers. Despite these hurdles, this new approach led to some unexpected benefits, including increased consistency and reduced drift, as well as a more streamlined and efficient infrastructure management process.
           </p>
           <p>
            Join us as we share the story of our journey, highlighting the technical challenges we faced and the solutions we developed to overcome them. We&#39;ll dive into the details of our architecture, discuss the trade-offs we made, and explore the lessons we learned along the way. If you&#39;re considering migrating your own research workloads to k8s, or simply want to learn from our experiences, this talk is for you.

            Exemplars are point in time observations made at the time of metric generation. These observations usually have things like trace ID and span ID which can be used to navigate from a time series graph to a trace water fall. SDKs of Prometheus and OpenTelemetry natively support the generation of exemplars given the application is pre instrumented with distributed tracing. At eBay, we have done the needful to ensure that all applications emit HTTP API related golden signals as metrics and traces for each API. Given this, we are able to emit Exemplars for every host&#39;s APIs based on status code, path and verb. These exemplars get stored in Prometheus&#39; circular ring buffer and is only available for a brief period of time depending on the ring buffer&#39;s memory.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            For more than a year, we used Open Telemetry Collector&#39;s tail sampling processor. Over time, we realized that our traffic patterns are not condusive to do true tail sampling and doing it on top of our trace store (ClickHouse) is the only way to do it. An ah ha! moment allowed us to come up with the idea of using Exemplars as the source of truth for what should be sampled and what should not given that Exemplars provide unique traces for every kind of status code, API path and host. Retaining those traces could give us a very good representative sample set. GIven this assumption, we built a tail sampler that could ingest all Exemplars into ClickHouse and run sampling jobs that sample based on the trace IDs in the Exemplars.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, the in-memory circular ring buffer where Exemplars are stored has very poor retention depending on how many exemplars come in. In certain cases, we have seen that it can only hold 15 minutes worth of Exemplars which is not as usually as one would want it to be. Yet another ah ha! moment was realizing that we could write a Exemplar query API to serve Exemplars from ClickHouse instead of Prometheus and retain Exemplars for the life of the trace.
           </p>
           <p>
            What ended up happening is that the metrics platform and the trace platform have built a symbiotic relationship and coexist together to support the broader Observability charter. The binding force for that are Exemplars.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this presentation we discuss how we built our metrics/trace platform, the novel Exemplar based tail sampler, long term Exemplar queries being served out of Clickhouse and how we are re-imagining ways in which metrics and traces can co-exist together. Audience at the end of this presentation would get simple ideas that they can both implement by themselves and benefit from using/adopting Exemplars in their own ecosystem.

            Open source security tools make security accessible. While their benefits are well known, they present a unique challenge: attackers have the same access to detection rules as defenders and contributors. This transparency can provide attackers with a roadmap to bypass defenses. How can open source contributors continue to maintain and evolve these tools while effectively countering attackers?
           </p>
           <p>
            This session explores the dynamic relationship between open source security tools and adversarial tactics. We’ll dive into strategies that empower open source contributors to stay ahead, such as leveraging community-driven intelligence and fostering collaborative ecosystems for rapid response to emerging threats. Attendees will learn practical approaches to balancing transparency with resilience, ensuring open source tools remain robust and effective despite the inherent visibility of their detection mechanisms. Whether you’re a contributor, maintainer, or user, this talk will offer insights into fortifying the open source security landscape against evolving attacker methodologies.

            Learn about the ecosystems in the Fedora and CentOS projects, and how you can package software for both. Fedora Linux is the leading edge, community built operating system. CentOS is the open source, community operating system derived from Fedora. Although separate projects, Fedora and CentOS have a lot in common, such as packaging and build infrastructure. Both projects also have a wide ecosystem of special interest groups that develop on top of the core operating systems.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will present an overview of the Fedora project followed by an overview CentOS ecosystem. We&#39;ll show how both systems are developed and what the various special interest groups are doing. We will then provide a packaging workshop where you can learn how to package your favorite software, whether you want it in Fedora, EPEL, a CentOS SIG, or just for your own personal use. No prior packaging experience is necessary, but we will assume a basic familiarity with Linux and the command line.

            We’ve all heard the usual insider talks about Nix. This session flips the script. Ron Efroni will lead a candid fireside chat with Kelsey Hightower, known for his pioneering work on Kubernetes, as we dive into his journey discovering Nix. Expect blunt takes on where Nix gets it right, where it needs a reality check, and what lessons from container orchestration might apply. If you’re curious about the raw, unfiltered truth of Nix’s present and future, don’t miss it.

            Many people really struggle with intentional career networking. It can seem scary or pointless or overwhelming, so they end up falling back on default networking, only maintaining professional relationships with those in their immediate circle of influence. Others are very intentional with their networking but end up being takers and not givers, offending those in their network. Still others are worried about asking for anything from their network for fear of seeming like a taker. Being a genuine person in the corporate world is a tricky business.

            I’m going to use basic IT systems networking concepts to illustrate career networking concepts in a way that DevOps folks can easily visualize. I will share my experiences with authentic career networking through the lens of systems networking, the good and the bad. Sometimes it has worked out favorably for me, a well balanced ingress and egress! And other times it has left me feeling super crappy and used, egress only sharing. All of it has been educational and has shown me how to be a better network-friend, a well-balanced router and have healthy firewalls. I want to share it all with you in hopes of seeing more authenticity and generosity in our shared work world.

            Testing code changes efficiently in microservices architecture is a critical challenge in modern software development. Static environments like staging, qa and dev are major bottlenecks and can slow down the development process. In this talk, we present a tool we&#39;ve developed and use at GoodRx that automatically creates ephemeral environments from GitHub pull requests managed directly by a comment block in the pull request. This enables developers to quickly test, share and get feedback on their changes in isolated, disposable environments before merging, enhancing code quality and accelerating development cycles. We will share our journey in building this tool, discuss its integration with existing workflows and its future.

            Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware disrupted the global virtualization market where VMware previously held 40% market share. Now, customers are re-evaluating their strategy and turning to cloud-native solutions. Over 80% of OpenInfra Members have already received requests to migrate users from VMware to OpenStack and over 60% of members have already completed a successful migration. Join us as we zero in on the virtualization market in North America and hear how OpenStack providers are building cloud-native migration strategies for their customers. Our panel of experts will be moderated by Jimmy McArthur, Director, Business Development at OpenInfra Foundation.

            If you have ever wondered what it takes to develop OpenStack, look no further. This workshop is designed for attendees with any level of OpenStack experience. In this workshop, we will provide attendees a walkthrough of making a code change into OpenStack. Attendees will understand how developers identify bugs/features to work on, create contributor accounts, develop the code change, test it against an OpenStack deployment and submit it for community code review. As seasoned core maintainers of OpenStack, we can share strategies we have learned to engage with the community and get these code changes merged. We hope this session will serve as a quickstart to in-person audiences who get to follow along hands-on.

            There are a lot of different secret management technologies around nixos, like sops-nix, agenix, etc. All of them still require to manually generate and encrypt secrets though. So we are happy to announce the missing piece to have full declarative services with zero user interaction: NixOS vars (name will maybe change :))

            In this session we&#39;ll go over the history of the OpenStack project before diving deeper into how it all works and how you can contribute. We will look at the landscape of the project as it is today, while diving deeper into what some of the projects are and the services they provide and how they interact together. We will finish with a call to action on how you can get involved in the project. After this session, you should walk away with a better understanding of OpenStack as a project and an infrastructure-as-a-service, and how you can get involved and contriibute to the project.

            Navigating application instrumentation can be daunting, even after adopting a widely used standard like OpenTelemetry. Setting up the entire pipeline—from instrumentation to visualization—often presents challenges. In this presentation, I will share my journey as a Go developer learning to collect and visualize telemetry data with OpenTelemetry, while also exploring some of the underlying mechanisms that make it work.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Although OpenTelemetry has become a popular open-source solution, implementing it effectively requires several key steps: instrumentation, data extraction, storage selection, and visualization. Deciding which solution to use at each step makes it challenging to produce a quick feedback loop. I will break down these steps, showing how getting started with OpenTelemetry can be straightforward, making use of the Grafana ecosystem for visualization.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Many developers, especially those who focus on coding, may find instrumentation and monitoring to be a secondary concern. When I first started, I found the process confusing, so I understand the need for clear, simple guidance. This talk aims to demystify getting started with OpenTelemetry, offering clear guidance to empower developers in taking ownership of their observability data.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            By helping newcomers navigate their initial steps in instrumentation, we encourage wider adoption of OpenTelemetry. This growing user base can provide valuable feedback and perspectives that drive the evolution of the project. Ultimately, this talk aims to equip newcomers with the knowledge to practically implement OpenTelemetry, paving the way for a collaborative cloud native community.

            Kubernetes is a declarative-first platform where manifests written in YAML describe what resources should exist in the cluster and on the nodes. Yet many new users will use imperative processes, running `kubectl apply` either manually or through CI, to define and change the state of their cluster. This approach is known as the “push” model, and while it works initially, it does not scale as more users adopt the platform. Without a shared understanding of the desired state, it’s impossible for teams to collaborate and make changes safely.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            A new dynamic must be set to solve these challenges. Actors outside of the cluster should not be able to make changes directly. Instead, changes should be made collaboratively to the desired state stored in Git. Then, the live state of the cluster is continuously reconciled by controllers running inside the cluster, to match the new desired state. GitOps practices provide a declarative approach to defining and managing the state of Kubernetes.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            During this presentation, attendees will get first hand experience using Argo CD to declaratively manage the deployment of Helm charts to Kubernetes clusters following GitOps practices.

            Anyone who has used the Ingress resource in Kubernetes for any length of time knows that it is lacking in flexibility and, as a result, has resulted in just about every ingress-related project creating their own bespoke resource types or complex set of needed annotations. Gateway API is the community’s answer to alleviating this pain. It aims to do this by being “generic, expressive, and role-oriented.” Its resource model focuses on
            <a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/#personas">
             3 separate personas
            </a>
            and the Kubernetes resources that they are expected to manage: the infrastructure provider, the cluster operator, and the application developer. The Ingress is specifically focused on HTTP/HTTPS traffic and, as a result, requires custom extensions to work with other types of traffic. Conversely, Gateway API works for both layer 4 and layer 7 traffic and has out-of-the-box support for gRPC, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, and UDP traffic along with support for TLS traffic where only the SNI information is used. It also takes things a step further and applies the same standardization logic, and resource types, to traffic traversing a service mesh.

            Data is the backbone of digital interactions and ensuring provenance and ownership is critical for security, privacy, and trust. David Grantham, CEO of Cryptid, will explore the challenges of verifying data authenticity, licensing data access, preventing manipulation, and enabling user control in decentralized systems. Drawing from his work at Cryptid Technologies, Hyperledger, and Polygon, he will discuss cryptographic techniques, zero-trust architectures, and decentralized identity frameworks that empower individuals and organizations to secure, track, and assert ownership over their data.

            Drug side effects are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, highlighting the need for improved detection and analysis methods. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating human-like text. Yet, their knowledge is limited by black-box training data, they are prone to hallucinations, and they often lack domain-specific knowledge. Here, we propose two architectures integrating domain knowledge about drug side effects into a Llama 3-8B Language Model through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG. Our extensive evaluations on 21,765 associations between 1,106 marketed drugs and 3,903 unique side effect terms show that GraphRAG achieves an accuracy of 99% in drug side effect retrieval. This suggests that our framework could be useful in providing accurate information on drug side effects in the context of Large Language Models.

            <strong>
             Presentation Overview
            </strong>
            <br>
            This session will feature a comprehensive demonstration about how to finetune and host generative AI models (e.g. Qwen2.5, llama3.2) using open-sourced solutions. We will show attendees how to finetune open-source models (e.g. Qwen2.5, Llama3.2) using the LLaMA-Factory library and how to host these finetuned models using the open-sourced vLLM library.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>
             Problem Statement
            </strong>
            <br>
            The generative AI landscape has largely dominated by proprietary solutions with closed models. This has fostered a mindset that generative AI is beyond the reach of practitioners and solely controlled OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>
             Proposed Solution
            </strong>
            <br>
            Open-source frameworks such as LLaMA-Factory and vLLM provide practitioners with full control over their AI models. These tools not only enable advanced fine-tuning through diverse training approaches—such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning routines (PPO, DPO) but also facilitate hosting on your own hardware, whether it be GPUs, TPUs, or XPUs.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>
             Benefits
            </strong>
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Ownership and Control: Maintain autonomy over your AI models, ensuring consistent performance aligned with your specific needs.
            </li>
            <li>
             Cost Efficiency: Hosting models independently can be extremely cost-effective, particularly in scenarios with high-scale usage.
            </li>
            <li>
             Model Customization: Benefit from various training methods to refine your models exactly as desired.
            </li>
            <li>
             Community Support: Take advantage of an open-source community that continually enhances these robust frameworks.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Conclusion
            </strong>
            <br>
            We will demonstrate the practical application of open-source frameworks like LLaMA-Factory and vLLM for fine-tuning and hosting generative AI models. By utilizing these tools, practitioners can gain greater control over their models, reduce operational costs, and tailor their AI solutions to specific needs. Additionally, the open-source community provides ongoing support and enhancements, making these frameworks a viable alternative to proprietary solutions in the generative AI landscape.

            MySQL Shell is a modern CLI for connecting to, and interacting with, MySQL Instances. But there is so much more!! In this session we will demonstrate some of the cooler, but lesser-known, features of MySQL Shell. These features include, but are not limited to: creating sandbox instances for testing, managing MySQL replication, and dumping data to (and loading data from) a cloud storage bucket.

            Scarab is an open-source environmental data collection robot designed to monitor air and water quality by detecting various gases in the surrounding environment. Built from repurposed parts, Scarab represents both an engineering challenge and a response to the growing concern over climate-related disasters, such as wildfires, that are increasingly affecting global air quality. My presentation will delve into the story behind Scarab’s creation, its technical features, the importance of open-source technology and how DIY robotics can play a role in advancing environmental science.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            The journey to create Scarab began as a challenge: could a basic, wearable robotic arm be repurposed into a walking robot? This led to the development of Scarab’s unique design, which is heavily influenced by both WWII bomber aesthetics and the industrial revolution&#39;s rugged, functional style. In terms of mechanics, Scarab’s movement was inspired by careful study and reverse engineering of insect and spider locomotion, allowing it to walk efficiently using a specific timing pattern for its legs.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            While initially conceived as a walking robot, Scarab’s purpose shifted dramatically after the 2023 Canadian wildfires. The thick smoke that covered parts of North America, particularly when the skies of New York City turned red due to smoke from Canadian wildfires, highlighted the need for real-time air quality monitoring. This environmental event inspired the integration of sensors capable of detecting harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and other pollutants. These sensors transformed Scarab from a mechanical curiosity into a valuable tool for environmental data collection, much like the Mars Rover’s sensors offer detailed analyses of the Martian environment.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            In its current form, Scarab can provide real-time readouts of gas levels in its immediate environment, offering valuable insights into the air quality during events like wildfires or industrial accidents. By making this data accessible and easy to interpret, Scarab aims to inform people about the potential health risks in their surroundings. This also underscores the interconnectedness of climate change: a wildfire in one country can have a measurable impact on air quality thousands of miles away, illustrating the global nature of environmental issues.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            Scarab is also a testament to the power of open-source technology. By sharing the plans, code, and design files on platforms like GitHub, the project encourages collaboration and customization. Anyone with the interest and drive can build their own version of Scarab, modify it to suit their needs, or use it as a base for further innovations. The accessibility of open-source projects like this lowers the barrier for entry into fields like robotics and environmental science, allowing more people to contribute to these critical areas of research and development.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            This presentation is ideal for a wide range of audiences, including robotics enthusiasts, environmental scientists, students, hobbyists, and advocates of open-source projects. Attendees will gain insights into how DIY robotics can be used for practical, impactful purposes, as well as how open-source technology enables innovation on a global scale. By the end of the talk, participants will have a better understanding of how projects like Scarab can play a part in addressing climate change, and they will leave with the tools and inspiration to begin their own projects.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            Moreover, Scarab serves as a reminder that cutting-edge technology does not have to be restricted to well-funded labs or large organizations. By leveraging open-source tools and a bit of ingenuity, anyone can create technology that contributes to solving real-world problems. The story of Scarab’s development, from its initial mechanical design to its current role as an environmental monitoring tool, demonstrates the potential of small-scale robotics to make a big difference.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            In conclusion, Scarab is more than just a robot—it’s a bridge between environmental science, robotics, and global cooperation. The project highlights the urgency of addressing environmental challenges, while also offering a path forward through collaboration and shared knowledge. Whether you&#39;re a seasoned engineer, a student curious about robotics, or someone passionate about climate action, this presentation will provide valuable insights into the future of DIY environmental science and the critical role that open-source projects play in advancing that future.

            How do we know that data in a database can be safely accessed and modified, and that concurrent actions won&#39;t break our data&#39;s integrity and introduce corruption? This question is fundamental to building safe applications—and, as we’ll see, to achieving high performance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take this example: John and Mary operate a store for the underserved hero community. Mary wants to apply a senior discount to eligible clients and does so inside a transaction, expecting it will prevent interference from concurrent activity. Meanwhile, John realizes Batman is only 30 and updates his age.
           </p>
           <p>
            <code>
             Mary&gt; BEGIN;
             <br>
             Mary&gt; SELECT * FROM heroes;
             <br>
             name | age | comment
             <br>
             &#39;Batman&#39; | 65 | &#39;&#39;
             <br>
            </code>
           </p>
           <p>
            <code>
             John&gt; SELECT * FROM HEROES;
             <br>
             &#39;Batman&#39; | 65 | &#39;&#39;
             <br>
             John&gt; UPDATE heroes SET age = 30 WHERE name = &#39;Batman&#39;;
             <br>
             1 row affected
             <br>
            </code>
            <br>
            Mary is a bit anxious, so she double-checks Batman&#39;s age:
            <br>
            <code>
             Mary&gt; SELECT * FROM heroes;
             <br>
             &#39;Batman&#39; | 65
             <br>
             Mary&gt; UPDATE heroes SET comment = &#39;senior discount&#39; WHERE name = &#39;Batman&#39;;
             <br>
             1 row affected
             <br>
             Mary&gt; COMMIT;
            </code>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, a question to you, reader: what is the final state of the heroes table? Assuming the default MySQL parameters, the table now looks like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            <code>
             name | age | comment
             <br>
             &#39;Batman&#39; | 30 | &#39;senior discount&#39;
            </code>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not at all the result that Mary wanted. What went wrong here? This is what this presentation is all about. We will see how to identify problems that can occur with concurrent transactions, why they occur, how to prevent them, and even how to allow some specific interference as a tradeoff for better performance if our application-specific data integrity constraints can allow it.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the main roles of databases is to ensure data integrity in the face of concurrent data access. In the simplest case, a simplistic database could use a single readers-writer lock, queuing all writers until all readers have finished, and vice versa. But this is hardly sufficient for many applications, where multiple clients might be updating and reading account balances, plane reservations, or other critical data, all at once.
           </p>
           <p>
            MySQL (and its default storage engine, InnoDB) handles this tradeoff by making use of configurable transaction isolation levels. To understand how these work and can be used to balance concurrency guarantees with performance, it&#39;s important to know how they&#39;re implemented. This is why we&#39;ll look at locking, Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), consistent nonlocking reads, read phenomena, and the four transaction isolation levels, with the help of numerous examples.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end, you&#39;ll be able to identify and fix concurrency issues in MySQL queries, prevent data corruption in critical operations, and make informed decisions about performance tradeoffs in transactions.

            I have a confession: I love Nix. So much so, that I want to use it to build all my software. But there&#39;s a catch - why is Nix so slow? My search for answers began with a bash loop run amok, and ends with Fantail - a new frontend development server powered by Nix and Haskell, with builds 5x faster than the Nix CLI. If you&#39;ve ever looked up at the sky and wondered if it&#39;s possible to use the Nix C++ interface to cache Flake inputs in-memory, this is the talk for you. If not, come along anyway!

            When plants move around in video games, it adds atmosphere, wether a gentle breeze or gale force winds. We will walk through some methods to create and animate grass and trees, using all open source software such as the Godot game engine, Blender, Gimp, and Krita. In this workshop, there will be a bit of texturing, a bit of simple mesh modeling, and a bit of mostly simple shader coding!

            For anyone that has ever had a job in vulnerability management, sifting through endless amounts of poorly written, ambiguous, misleading vulnerability advisories has never been a fun part of the job. Information is often withheld or left out, their descriptions are hard to understand, and sometimes they are unfortunately just plain wrong. For a long time, vulnerability databases like the NVD have been heralded as a single source of truth when they, like all things, are fallible. My aim is to bring attention to this problem, and to help security researchers (and anyone else involved in the vulnerability disclosure process) write advisories that significantly help other security practitioners, making their jobs and lives much easier. In the talk, I will start by giving a brief introduction to the current public vulnerability ecosystem, and once that’s established, explain why anyone listening should even care to hear this talk. After that I’ll go over the key factors that go into creating a useful and actionable vulnerability description and disclosure. For each factor, I will give at least one good and one bad example, and give tips on what to do and what not to do. I will finish the talk with a brief walkthrough of the vulnerability disclosure process, a summary, and a call (plead) to action (for better advisories).

            Infrastructure-as-Code, as its name implies, allows engineers to provision infrastructure resources through code, thereby providing a safe, consistent, and repeatable process. But as IaC has continued to grow in popularity, so too have the myriad tools available to enable it.

            Curious about the Nix module system but don’t know where to start? This talk introduces the core concepts and basics of the Nix module system, designed for those new to Nix. We’ll break down how it works, why it’s so powerful for declarative configuration, and how you can start using it for your own projects. No prior experience is required—just a willingness to explore and learn!

            This talk will highlight the ongoing challenges with implementing OpenStack Neutron ML2/OVN and Ironic/SR-IOV external ports. We&#39;ll discuss the root causes of these issues, the solutions currently under development, and their status in the upstream OpenStack community (including testing and reviews). Additionally, we&#39;ll share temporary workarounds to address these challenges in production environments.

            Is the term &#34;AI&#34; obfuscating every practical conversation about everything? Can we cut through the noise and ride this wave by understanding, designing, and deploying a new breed of search, fully integrated with your existing data and database? Yes, yes, we can!
            <br>
            This talk will dig into the weeds of vector search. We&#39;ll explore both the core math of the technology, as well as the applicability to a wide variety of use cases. We&#39;ll differentiate it from preceding search technologies and find how it fits within an overall data retrieval strategy.
            <br>
            I&#39;ll discuss some concrete ways this can make your life better, but also touch on some pitfalls you might want to watch for.
           </p>
           <p>
            Attending this session will help you:
            <br>
            1) Understand what Vector Search is and how it works
            <br>
            2) Discover the ways that vector search and &#34;semantic search&#34; help solve problems
            <br>
            3) Learn about some concrete implementations of vector search and how to integrate this architecture into your project
            <br>
            4) Pros and cons of using vector search vs. keyword search

            Cloud-native applications comprise various components including data services, storage systems, and related Kubernetes objects. Each component requires its own data protection tools, strategy, and domain expertise. A robust solution aligned with business requirements often involves complex workflows.
            <br>
            As databases and persistent workloads hosted on Kubernetes grows, cloud native data protection is needed to address the gaps of traditional backup and recovery solutions.
            <br>
            While there are many open source and commercial offerings in the market, many automate backups with scripting and cron, addressing only the first step of data protection.
            <br>
            This talk explores typical challenges of data protection on Kubernetes and describes how we can manage the data protection complexity using K8s and Kanister.
            <br>
            Followed by a live demo featuring application-consistent backup and restore of AWS RDS.

            Learn more about how Kata Containers, an open source, secure container runtime project, utilizes virtualization technology to overcome the biggest gap in traditional containers, the lack of isolation. The project is running in production in large public clouds, financial institutions, and being utilized for machine learning use cases to ensure data privacy. For an additional layer of protection the community is actively collaborating with the Confidential Containers (CoCo) project, which brings confidential computing mechanisms into the container space.
            <br>
            <br>
            This presentation will provide a technology overview of Kata Containers, including its integration with CoCo, and highlight a couple of interesting use cases to show the project in action. Session attendees will also get a sneak peek into the project’s roadmap and upcoming 4.0 release.

            Have you ever wanted your own private version of ChatGPT, running securely on your own devices? While large language models (LLMs) can do amazing things, many users hesitate to send their sensitive files and data to companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, or Anthropic for processing. The good news is that it’s possible to set up your own local, controlled LLM using open-source tools, ensuring both privacy and flexibility. This talk will show you how to take advantage of these tools, guiding you through every step of the process.
           </p>
           <p>
            We’ll start by covering the basics of installation, from choosing the right open-source LLM for your needs to setting it up on your system. Next, you’ll learn how to customize and optimize your model, ensuring it delivers the best results for your specific tasks and requirements. Whether you need it to help with coding, content creation, or data analysis, you’ll gain insights on how to tailor the LLM to meet your goals. Throughout the presentation, we’ll provide clear, easy-to-follow demos that break down each part of the setup, so you can see exactly how it all comes together.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end of this session, you’ll have the knowledge to create your own “mini-Jarvis,” ready to assist you with a range of tasks—all while keeping your data securely under your control. No more relying on third-party servers or worrying about privacy; instead, you’ll have a powerful, local AI that you can customize and manage as you see fit. Join us to discover how you can harness the potential of LLMs on your own terms, using open-source solutions to build a smart, effective, and private tool that truly works for you.

            Replication conflicts can disrupt the consistency and reliability of a PostgreSQL database, especially in high-demand environments. This talk focuses on practical steps for monitoring, detecting, and resolving common replication conflicts. Topics will include understanding and configuring PostgreSQL’s conflict resolution parameters, handling long-running queries that cause snapshot conflicts, and using replication conflict logs for troubleshooting. We’ll also look at logical replication conflicts, both data and transaction ordering with an overview of how these challeges are resolved by the open source Spock extension which is based on pglogical.

            Having visibility into the Linux kernel is critical for running resilient Linux workloads. eBPF is a powerful technology that provides that visibility, but it is complex and can be challenging to get started with. In this presentation, we will briefly introduce eBPF and demonstrate how to leverage its superpowers for observability using the open-source project Inspektor Gadget through real life use cases. Inspektor Gadget is a tool and framework for data collection and system inspection on Linux hosts and Kubernetes clusters using eBPF. We will show how Inspektor Gadget’s modular framework can be used to collect real time metrics so that you have visibility into the Linux kernel in a way that makes sense for you. We will demonstrate a variety of gadgets to give a feel for what kind of valuable Linux kernel metrics can be surfaced using eBPF and Inspektor Gadget. We will also introduce you to the framework of Inspektor Gadget so that you can see how it easily integrates with your existing observability and monitoring tech stack, including integration with open source tools like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. We hope you will join us for a fruitful conversation!

            Quick, what&#39;s the difference between the mean, the mode and the median? Do you need a Gaussian or a normal distribution And does your choice impact the alerts and observations you get from your observability tools?
            <br>
            <br>
            Come get refreshed on the impact some basic choices in statistical behavior can have on what gets triggered. Learn why a median might be the choice for historical anomaly or sudden change. Jump into Gaussian distributions, data alignment challenges and the trouble with sampling. Walk out with a deeper understanding of your metrics and what they might tell you.

            Running OpenStack on Kubernetes is a great idea - users can leverage their Kubernetes platform expertise and run the OpenStack clouds and services that they need while also adding in additional cloud native workloads that enhance their OpenStack experience.

            On the other hand, running OpenStack on Kubernetes adds a huge additional layer of complexity for Day 2 operators.  When something goes wrong (as it always will), how can you find and resolve it quickly in all the operational layers?

            One big advantage with OpenStack on Kubernetes is the potential to augment the Observability stack.  Rather than relying on just the OpenStack Observability services, users can also leverage Cloud Native Observability in order to get a more comprehensive view of their systems, and help reduce that Mean Time to Remediation and Resolution.  In this talk, we will discuss ways to use several Open Source technologies to get end to end Observability for OpenStack on Kubernetes.

            Imagine performing a routine Linux OS update on your Kubernetes cluster nodes. Boom—everything breaks, and suddenly you can’t even SSH into the nodes. You instantly know it’s going to be a “fun” day. The culprit? A subtle iptables version incompatibility lurking beneath the surface. As Kubernetes system components increasingly package low-level system tools, a new set of compatibility challenges has emerged. This talk explores three such “dragons” that Kubernetes engineers face when kernel compatibility issues crop up in containerized environments: modprobe, iptables, and ipset.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each of these system tools, developed long before containers were widespread, brings unique and often hidden compatibility issues. First, we’ll explore
            <em>
             modprobe
            </em>
            , where Debian-based container images ship with gzip-compressed kernel modules incompatible with the xz compression method used by Kubernetes components, making it impossible for certain containers to load kernel modules. Next, we’ll dive into
            <em>
             iptables
            </em>
            , the tool at the heart of Linux and Kubernetes networking, where incompatibilities between versions can break critical functions and complicate rule management across components and host levels. Finally, we’ll look at
            <em>
             ipset
            </em>
            , a tool that fails if its version is older than the kernel itself, leading to unexpected issues during routine kernel updates.
           </p>
           <p>
            We’ll share how these challenges affect Kubernetes stability, some of the troubleshooting paths we took, and what we did to handle these problems. Join us to understand the tricky relationship between Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, and the low-level tools we rely on—and learn how to prepare for the next compatibility dragon lurking in your stack.

            Kubernetes was designed to be the best container orchestration platform on top of a cloud infrastructure in one data center. What do you do when you want to take your deployment and grow it in various geographical locations, but sill keep it as part of one system?
            <br>
            <br>
            You will have to face with complexity and figure out infrastructure management on a massive scale, and neither of these is easy to tackle. However, you don&#39;t have to go back to the drawing board, because the platform that delivers on requirements and expectations, already exists and it is called StarlingX.
            <br>
            <br>
            The StarlingX project is a fully integrated, open source cloud platform that is running in production at large telecom operators, who rely on its distributed cloud architecture along with next-level container orchestration support, which is provided by Kubernetes.
            <br>
            <br>
            This talk will introduce the StarlingX platform, share highlights from its latest release and show how it takes Kubernetes to the next level!

            Length: 2.5 hours (including concluding Q&amp;A)
           </p>
           <p>
            Prerequisites: Familiarity with the Linux command line and basic networking; user creation of a Kubernetes cluster in their own cloud account or VM(s) for lab use prior to the session.  Note: clusters for use with this session should have workers which are accessible via SSH or other direct command-line access, e.g. Amazon EKS with EC2 workers.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Preferred: Familiarity with Terraform/OpenTofu and the AWS CLI; ownership of an AWS account; creation of an EKS cluster for lab use prior to the session (Terraform config for creating a basic EKS cluster will be provided).  Other clouds/VMs and Kubernetes distributions may be used but configuration specifics may differ from examples presented.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This lab will dive into how the high-level concepts of Kubernetes components and workloads are reflected on the nodes those components and workloads run on. Topics covered include:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Container images and filesystems
            </li>
            <li>
             Container processes: namespaces and cgroups; execution environment inside a container
            </li>
            <li>
             Container networking: bridges and virtual interfaces
            </li>
            <li>
             Basic Kubernetes components and how they run on control plane nodes
            </li>
            <li>
             Kubernetes workload abstractions: mechanics of pods
            </li>
            <li>
             Kubernetes traffic routing and service discovery: iptables and cluster DNS
            </li>
            <li>
             TLS in Kubernetes clusters
            </li>
            <li>
             (if time permits) Service mesh basics: sidecar proxies, per-node proxies and eBPF
            </li>

           <p>
            This is a pragmatic look at PostgreSQL&#39;s support for locales, in particular around character encoding and collations. This is intended for DBAs and developers who want to make use of PostgreSQL&#39;s extensive locale features with a minimum number of gotchas. Among the topics are:
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            * A quick overview of locales, character encodings, and collations.
           </p>
           <p>
            * What a &#34;locale provider,&#34; and how do you use it?
           </p>
           <p>
            * How do various collations perform, really?
           </p>
           <p>
            * What are the use cases for various locales?
           </p>
           <p>
            * And what is this horrible thing about index corruption I hear about?
           </p>
           <p>
            The goal is to provide developers and DBAs enough information to make informed decisions about how to apply the PostgreSQL locale system in a real-life database, and how to avoid pitfalls and gotchas.

            Learning Nix can be off-putting, as many introductions dive into complex terminology and academic concepts, missing the chance to simplify Nix&#39;s advantages. Having given talks both internally and externally, I&#39;ve shifted to showcasing fun, practical examples first, leaving the nuances for later. Join me to see some straightforward examples of what Nix can offer and why it might be worth adopting.

            This will be a casual presentation by a former Mexican government official. The talk will touch upon legislation established in federal law in Mexico and government agencies structured to promote the use of open source while driving sovereignty. It will also cover some experiences and lessons learned by the presenter in their experience of driving open-source projects from within the government and some examples that are currently in operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            This talk also hopes to become an open and accessible space where participants can openly inquire about common issues that hinder and slow the adoption of open-source infrastructure in government or their institutions.

            Whether you are just starting your career as a database user for data analytics or already an expert Database Administrator (DBA) to detect the overall performance or a product manager to view the usage of the user data, you need multiple tools and techniques to manipulate data into visual metrics to track the most important KPIs in your organization. However, sharing such information with others can be challenging as it requires the same skills and tools to get the same results.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, we will demonstrate an example of how you can visualize and monitor both time-series or cross-sectional data in MySQL to represent it in various visualization formats and get key metrics or find trends by using Grafana dashboards. Also, we will gain insight into details by applying Alerting rules to trigger notifications for any unexpected results and send it to your entire team.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will be an introduction to the Grafana Dashboards and also an excellent opportunity to learn more about utilizing advanced options to effectively extract and represent meaningful data in a human readable visualization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Join us to learn more about Grafana dashboards, community contributions and share your feedback and suggestions!

            In an era where AI is reshaping software development, the OpenInfra community stands at the forefront of integrating foundational models (FMs) and AI agents into open-source workflows. This talk delves into how OpenInfra projects can capitalize on these technologies to address pressing challenges such as contributor productivity, energy efficiency, and climate change.
           </p>
           <p>
            By utilizing datasets from OpenInfra projects and adhering to OpenInfra workflows, I&#39;ve conducted experiments within the OpenStack and Hugging Face ecosystems. I&#39;ve fine-tuned a suite of open-source models—including LLaMA 3, CodeT5, SantaCoder, Mistral-7B, and OpenLLaMA-13B—to assist developers and contributors in a variety of socio-technical activities. These activities encompass micro-collaboration, documentation enhancement, code review optimization, test case generation, event planning, predictive analytics in CI/CD pipelines, and automation—all within the context of OpenInfra projects.
           </p>
           <p>
            The result is a significant boost in contributor productivity across more than 21 distinct use cases, demonstrating the tangible benefits of integrating GenAI into open-source development. This talk will provide the OpenInfra community with practical insights and best practices for leveraging foundation models to accelerate development, improve sustainability, and address climate change effectively.

            The Linux kernel, due to its use across countless systems worldwide, is a prime target for attackers. And, with the number of exploitable kernel vulnerabilities steadily rising, prioritizing security is essential. While the kernel offers many built-in self protection mechanisms, some gaps remain. For instance, the Linux kernel lags in the current state of the art in virtualization based security (VBS). In this talk we introduce Linux Virtualization Based Security (LVBS), a security feature that can a) harden the kernel and b) ensure that critical kernel resources remain untampered, even if the kernel gets compromised. VBS uses hardware virtualization and the hypervisor (Hyper-V) to create an isolated virtual environment that runs as a higher trust level, called Virtual Trust Level 1 (VTL1). VTL1 has its own kernel, referred to as the secure kernel, where a number of security solutions are hosted.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, an overview of LVBS will be given, starting with our motivation and threat model and providing the context needed for understanding VBS. We will then examine the high-level architecture, which includes a hypervisor-agnostic common layer, and delve deeper into some Hyper-V specific components. We will also present the interface between the guest kernel (VTL0) and secure kernel (VTL1), talk about how we boot the secure kernel and extend secure boot to verify it, and explore the security features, which include control register pinning, memory access protections, and module authentication. A demonstration of a simulated attack attempting unauthorized memory modification will be shown to see how LVBS protects the kernel and handles exceptions. Finally, we will discuss the current status of our work and future work items such as trustlet support, integration with confidential computing, and support for text patching features.

            You need your own data to be useful with AI and LLMs. How do you go about that? There has been a lot of focus on making applications intelligent using the power of AI with the help of large language models (LLMs). In this we will cover how to add intelligence to existing applications with an overview of different techniques starting from prompt engineering, using vector stores to improve the results, and building intelligent agents to figure out how to solve a problem.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            You will learn about the techniques using open-source frameworks to build LLM-powered applications like LangChain &amp; LlamaIndex.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Beyond the techniques, there is the quesiton of optimization. What are some practical techniques around deploying these kinds of applications to production, understanding if they work, and improving them over time.

            Linux From Scratch, an online project directed by Gerard Beekmans, acts as a step-by-step guide for anyone who wants to build their own Linux distribution at home. The book carefully guides its readers through the tedious process of installing and compiling every package needed to make a Linux distribution bootable.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            In October of this year, I decided that I would begin the process of constructing a Linux From Scratch build. I have held an interest in open-source software and Linux ever since I was about nine. In elementary school I experimented with Raspberry Pis, using them to emulate games and to help my grandma print out recipes, in middle school I self-hosted web and Minecraft servers off my friend’s used Optiplex, using Debian over SSH, and in high school I used WSL and Vim to complete my AP Computer Science assignments. Trusting in my experience and feeling confident in my Linux abilities, I estimated Linux From Scratch would take me less than two days.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Two weeks later, now the proud owner of a text-only, package-manager-less Linux distribution that immediately throws two warnings upon login, I am both humbled and fatigued. But I also now understand more about Linux at a very low level than I have ever understood before. Linux From Scratch has been the best explanation I have ever received of what Linux actually is, and, to me, Linux From Scratch serves as an example of how “doing it yourself” can provide a uniquely comprehensive understanding of whatever it is you are “doing.” Is making Linux From Scratch the best way to understand Linux? No, probably not. But, in this presentation, not only will I tell the story of how I got my own build working, I will also make the case for why, maybe, you should build one for yourself.

            Confidential Computing is a technology that enables processing of sensitive data in a secure enclave that is a Hardware based trusted execution environment (TEE). With this technology, data in use becomes inaccessible to even internal administrators, thus enabling technical assurance of data security instead of operational assurance. There are multiple implementations of Confidential Computing available like Secure Execution (IBM), SEV (AMD) , SGX (Intel) etc. With more and more focus on AI and other technology space like Digital Asset, Confidential Computing is a sought after technology to ensure that personal or sensitive data is not hacked into. In this session, we will cover how OpenStack can be used as a cloud control plane to manage a Confidential Computing Infrastructure, its provisioning and life cycle management. We will demonstrate this using Secure Execution, which is a IBM Z Systems Implementation of Confidential Computing.

            The Zuul project gating system is used to test changes across multiple git repositories and code review systems before they merge.  For the past 12 years, it has relied on an external program called Nodepool to manage test resources and image builds.
            <br>
            <br>
            The functionality provided by Nodepool has been merged into Zuul, enabling a new way for developers to self-manage both virtual and physical test resources using standard Zuul workflows.
           </p>
           <p>
            That means speculative execution for image builds, custom images that can be managed by project developers instead or a central CI team, and horizontal scaling of cloud resources to run thousands of CI jobs per hour.
            <br>
            <br>
            James Blair will present a brief overview of Zuul for those who are new to the project, and share how to manage test nodes and images with Zuul&#39;s newest features.

            Recognizing, troubleshooting, and remediating incidents on the services your team owns and runs is hard enough; when the incident is actually happening to an upstream vendor, what can you do? Large outages might get attention from mainstream media, or at least be well-recognized among other technology teams. Those large incidents can have catastrophic results for your organization. Smaller or more obscure might just be a temporary annoyance.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            How your team handles vendor outages is more and more important as many teams become more dependent on SaaS and cloud providers for most of their tool chain as well as their production environments. This session will discuss how to plan for vendor incidents, what to have on hand, and provide some suggestions for how your team can cope when someone else is having a very bad day.

            Ever wondered how container images are organized? Are you curious why some containers take forever to load and start while other containers start right away? Did you know that &#34;docker build&#34; is not the only way to build container images? Did you know that you can build containers without Docker? Do you want to learn how to build container images without any container tools?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you answered yes to any of these questions this talk is for you! You&#39;ll learn how container images are structured and you&#39;ll learn different ways you can build container images.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll start by exploring how container images are stored locally and how they are stored in container registries. We&#39;ll see what happens when you start a container and the container image is not available locally. Normally container images need to be fully loaded before the container can start its execution. We&#39;ll discover what can be done to start running containers before their images are fully loaded.
           </p>
           <p>
            With everything we&#39;ve learned about the containers so far we&#39;ll try to create a container image manually using a text editor and the tar utility.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end we&#39;ll explore different container tools to build container images locally and in the cloud including the tools that let you build container images on demand when you execute the &#34;docker run&#34; command.

            One of the most useful things to come out of the modern technology stack is real-time maps. They help keep people from getting lost, help them find restaurants and shopping, and can give people a spatial context of the world around them.  Originally, maps were provided by commercial services such as Google Maps and Mapquest, but those services could be limiting and expensive.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2010 a company called Mapbox created a project to provide mapping libraries using an open source development method. It was adopted by a large number of applications until 2020, when the license was changed to one that is proprietary. This caused a number of people in the Mapbox community to fork the project into MapLibre, and since then the project has continured to grow as well as to attract support from some of the largest companies in technology today.
           </p>
           <p>
            This session will cover two things. First, it will provide a basic introduction on how to use MapLibre to add or improve the maps that already exist in web pages and mobile applications, and second it will show how MapLibre was able to successfully fork Mapbox by creating a welcoming and self-sustaining community. In addition, the session closes with a roadmap of where MapLibre is headed in the future.

            When launching new products or dealing with an outage, customer-facing teams see terms thrown around internally that customers might not identify with immediately. Good communication practices, including good translation of engineering terminology to customer-friendly communication, can save time and increase customer satisfaction when moments matter. Your customer facing teams&#39; unique ability to understand both what is happening internally as well as what customers need to hear positions this team as the experts to steer communications during major incidents.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Come to this talk to learn how to partner with your customer-facing teams during major incidents and build both internal and external trust along the way.

            Mentorship can be a powerful tool for cultivating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive tech pipeline. For mentors and maintainers, investing in these relationships can help to grow and sustain their technical communities. Meanwhile, mentees can benefit from a sense of belonging, alongside technical learning and professional development. Join us for a conversation about four mentorship initiatives serving as onramps to open source, especially for those minoritized in tech; these include a variety of models for bridging community colleges, research universities, and HBCUs with industry open source. We’ll discuss how these collaborations have been beneficial to everyone involved, and how such efforts can be beneficial to you as a potential mentor, maintainer, or mentee. We’ll then open up the floor to questions and conversation about mentorship in open source — and how you can get involved.

            We have significantly improved the detection and mitigation time of mesh/network-related incidents by implementing an ability to isolate and measure latencies across mesh components. The following proposal elaborates on how we’ve overcome this challenge.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong id="docs-internal-guid-05e3c357-7fff-757f-e96e-7b2429b4945a">

           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Measuring infrastructure latency has been a long-standing challenge, as latencies are hard to isolate and measure. Mesh-related incident detection and restore time need to be improved, as we didn’t have breakdown data and isolated measurements for each of our mesh components and all of the requests. In short, setting SLI/SLOs on infrastructure latency by aggregating accurate metrics across all mesh components will give us the ability to detect and mitigate infrastructure incidents efficiently.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Given the challenges we have faced, we have concluded that sampled metrics (i.e., Istio/client metrics) are not sufficient for this task due to the inability to detect minor changes with such resolutions. In addition, client metrics do not necessarily indicate network issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            The implemented solution is based on the idea of injecting headers along the way for each of the mesh components. The latency is measured by Envoy sidecars on the request flow, and measurements are injected into it. By subtracting between measurement values, we can isolate and construct fitted histograms (there will be a diagram), and thus, we can allow high accuracy, which contributes to early incident detection time.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            We have implemented designated dependencies for our main framework components, covering our workloads extensively. When the client-side host receives a response, we extract the header measurements, process them, and expose latency-accurate histograms and trace spans.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Using the power of openTelemetry tracing, we can insert custom spans into actual application traces. Measurements are shown as separate spans, allowing us to distinguish between application and mesh/network latency issues in the trace and also pointing to related components.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Using the data produced and collected, we have built end-to-end visibility of latency breakdown for each of our mesh/network components. Constructing SLI/SLOs for all mesh/network components enables us to use anomaly detection methods to spot and alert automatically and to triage incidents efficiently (with proven examples). This includes showing latency from the services perspective, which allows us to shorten the time we detect and mitigate network-related issues.

            Organizations of all kinds face similar challenges with managing the vast amounts of data their systems generate, and traditional monitoring methods often struggle to effectively handle the increasing complexity and scale. In this session, we’ll take a close look at how AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are redefining observability by automating data analysis, detecting anomalies instantly, enabling more intuitive system interactions, and assisting in post-incident learning opportunities.
            <br>
            Through real-world examples, we’ll learn how AI-driven observability uncovers hidden patterns, minimizes false alarms, and accelerates correlation discovery, leading to faster and more accurate issue resolution and enhanced understanding of how our systems work.
            <br>
            Join me in a breakdown of how today’s AI-powered monitoring is enhancing system reliability and reducing the need for manual troubleshooting, all while improving overall performance and bringing systems into the modern world of observability.

            As OpenStack emerged in 2010 the community infrastructure needed to authenticate community members.  As many of those community members already used Ubuntu and Canonical, provided Ubuntu One as and Identity Provider, it was a natural fit.  Fast forward 15(ish) years.  OpenStack becomes OpenInfra and the tools to support a single project, now need to support several aligned technologies on a single platform, OpenDev.  It just makes sense to broaden the pool of Identity providers to best align with each project, and as a bonus avoid a single point of failure.  To that end the OpenDev sysadmins have begun integrating Keycloak as an Identity broker, and authorisation provider. This is a great success for &#34;green fields&#34; tools but the catch?  Well there are several; Keycloak doesn&#39;t support OpenID (which is the protocol provided by Ubuntu One); there  is no trivial tool for establishing the pre-existing mappings needed to ensure developers can keep ... developing and last but by no means least Keycloak is written in Java (you may not know this but Java isn&#39;t Python!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Join the OpenDev Sysadmins on the journey through the maze of jargon,  OpenID, OpenID Connect, OAuth, tools Java, Maven, Quarkus as they find the path from problem to solution.

            As generative AI applications become increasingly prevalent in production environments, developers face unique security challenges that traditional application security may not fully address. This session explores emerging security patterns and community-driven initiatives for protecting GenAI applications, with a focus on practical threat modeling techniques developed through open source collaboration.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            The rapid adoption of generative AI in production applications has introduced novel adversarial attack risks and security considerations that the open source community is actively working to address. Through the lens of ongoing work from key industry working groups - including the OpenSSF, OPEA Security Working Group, and others - this talk will examine how the security community is coming together to establish best practices and frameworks for secure AI development.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            Participants will gain insights into the current work-in-progress status of various open source security initiatives, including draft frameworks, proposed standards, and evolving threat taxonomies. The session will highlight how these community efforts are shaping practical security approaches, from prompt injection prevention to model supply chain security.

            Nix in the Wild is a series where we interview users of Nix and ask them about their journey. We want to know about the good moments and the bad, and we want to tell it like it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            What makes users choose Nix? How long does it take for them to get their colleagues onboard? What do they learn along the way?
           </p>
           <p>
            In this quick talk, Ross from Flox will go over a few of the most amazing stories from Nix in the Wild (rawr!)...and let you know how we can help you tell yours.

            Evaluating packages with big dependency trees with nix is time consuming. Currently, while there is a local eval cache, evaluation costs are sum up locally but also globally as eval caches are generally not shared across machine or user boundaries. In other places such as searching packages, evaluation is impossible, prohibitively expensive, or just annoying. In this talk I want to introduce different approaches to avoid evaluations, how they are motivated and what their limits are.

            OpenStack resolves many challenge even in container era and RAN. Tacker is contributing to telecom usecase to O-RAN SC which is a collaboration between the O-RAN ALLIANCE and Linux Foundation aiming to achieve a solution to unify and accelerate the evolution in the RAN. Many telco and vendor companies has joined to the community for expanding their usecases including autonomative and intelligent system management.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tacker is a Generic VNF Manager designed for managing lifecycle of RAN components and enables user to deploy network functions on OpenStack or Kubernetes for scalability and availability. Performance/fault management of are the key features of VNFM for running large scale virtualized network systems, but still not enough for strict requirements of vRAN such as managing heavy traffic load or energy efficiency on complex network.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the current O-RAN SC model, Tacker manages network functions as a part of Deployment Management Service (DMS) with StarlingX. Tacker triggers operations such as registering software images on StarlingX for autonomous deployment. We&#39;ll share the future loadmap of the multi-community collaboration and the recent result of PoC at O-RAN Plugfest.

            This talk explores the threat landscape faced by online merchants accepting card payments. It provides an overview of card-not-present transactions and the roles of merchants, issuers, and cardholders. The session delves into three major types of threats, examining the value they present to attackers and offering insights into detection and mitigation strategies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This talk begins with a detailed examination of the anatomy of a credit card, emphasizing the importance of the Primary Account Number (PAN) in the transaction process. It then transitions to a brief history of card-not-present (CNP) transactions, outlining the roles of merchants, issuers, acquirers, and card networks within the payment ecosystem.
           </p>
           <p>
            The core of the presentation focuses on three specific types of attacks that online merchants encounter:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Data Thieves: These attackers seek to steal card details by intercepting data in transit or accessing stored card data. The 2018 British Airways hack, which compromised 380,000 cardholder details, serves as a prominent example. The talk underscores the critical importance of PCI-DSS compliance in safeguarding cardholder information.
            </li>
            <li>
             Card Testers: Often using automated scripts, card testers exploit merchant systems to validate stolen card details. The discussion includes detection strategies such as monitoring authorization rates and traffic patterns, and proposes mitigation measures including the use of CVV, AVS, and 3D Secure.
            </li>
            <li>
             Fraudsters: These individuals utilize stolen card details to purchase goods, services, or directly extract money. The necessity of a robust risk engine to detect and mitigate fraudulent activities through the identification of anomalous patterns is emphasized.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            A key takeaway from this session is the challenge of balancing security with customer experience. While the ideal scenario would involve blocking all fraudulent transactions while approving all legitimate ones, the reality is far more complex. Merchants must integrate multiple signals and make informed decisions tailored to the specific risks their business faces, striking a delicate balance between friction to bad actors and user experience.

            This talk presents the architecture and implementation of a real-time voice understanding system for retail environments, powered by open source AI technologies and deployed on NVIDIA Jetson devices. The system integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR) and large language models (LLMs) to process customer interactions in real-time, enabling conversation understanding, summarization, and sentiment analysis. We will explore system architecture design, selection and evaluation of ASR and LLM models, design trade-offs between latency and accuracy, and share performance test results.

            AI is becoming an integral part of our daily lives, assisting with everything from organization to decision-making. But if we&#39;re not careful, personal AI will once again be locked behind proprietary platforms, exposing users&#39; most sensitive information to privacy and security risks. As the performance of personal AI systems improves with more (and more recent) data, maintaining complete control has never been more important.
           </p>
           <p>
            This session will explore why open-source AI is essential for ensuring personal AI remains private, working for you rather than commercial vendors. We’ll discuss the risks of proprietary AI, the growing need for data sovereignty, and how open-source AI offers a secure, customizable alternative. We will also introduce pAI-OS, our own open-source personal AI operating system, designed to empower users with AI they can trust.

            Infrastructure lays the foundation for every daily function and open source drives innovation, cost savings, and adaptability. Together, open infrastructure has adapted to global and regional trends to disrupt proprietary market holds and drive human progress. In the face of recent trends, like licensing changes and redefining infrastructure for AI, open source communities are continuing to collaborate to evolve the projects behind an $8.8 trillion USD market. Hear how these communities are responding and how Walmart has evolved its OpenStack strategy over the past decade.

            Join us for a story of breakthroughs, lessons learned, and a vision for an open, unstoppable cloud future. It’s bold, resilient, and definitely not waiting for permission.
           </p>
           <p>
            From our unorthodox beginnings to shaping the cloud landscape, Rackspace has always embraced the unexpected. In the early days, we were just a small player offering virtual private servers—completely unaware that the cloud revolution was already underway. By 2010, we helped catalyze a shift in how businesses build and manage infrastructure, and yes, we did that without breaking too many things along the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, we’re pushing boundaries once again!  Enter openCenter, our enterprise release of open infrastructure, built on top of game-changing solutions and the best of breed open-ecosystems. openCenter slashes operational overhead, cuts complexity, and gives OpenStack a jolt of modernity for today’s business needs. We&#39;ve even rolled out a community edition (Genestack) because clouding is always more fun when you&#39;re doing it with friends.

            In this demo, we demonstrate how OpenStack edge cloud deployments across various data centers integrate with SONiC VPP switches over x86 servers to tackle these challenges. By using OpenStack’s Neutron for network service management, edge traffic routing through major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google) while maintaining control at the edge. This approach is ideal for critical edge applications, such as IoT and AI/ML, leveraging network slicing to provide a secure, multi-tenant environment. Together, OpenStack and SONiC VPP switches over x86 servers offer a high-performance connectivity solution optimized for low-latency, high-throughput requirements essential for edge computing.

            , touches all parts of an environment. When it works well -- it&#39;s great! Users are able to provision instances quickly and manage them without fail. Providing this simple, abstracted interface can make it easy to take for granted the complicated set of events which have to succeed for that instance to be provisioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hardware failures, network blips, and power outages are only a small number of the issues you may encounter in the real world. As the complexity stacks in the real world, so does the potential failure points -- OpenStack generally manages this well. However, as typical in IT, when the job is done well, nobody notices; OpenStack is a victim of this perceptional bias, when it works it&#39;s in the background, but when it fails it&#39;s difficult to ignore.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll discuss several ways to mitigate this perception, including:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ensuring monitoring differentiates physical failures from software failures
            </li>
            <li>
             Using capacity planning and availability zones to improve user experience around failure
            </li>
            <li>
             Internal marketing successes to your non-technical managers and staff
            </li>
            <li>
             Setting reasonable uptime expectations
            </li>
           </ul>

            As Personal AI technology advances, its potential applications extend far beyond convenience—transforming emergency response, and real-world problem-solving. This talk explores Kwaai’s ongoing work and developing use cases for how pAI can empower individuals, institutions, and communities through intelligent, decentralized AI systems that prioritize privacy, autonomy, and adaptability.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jon will highlight the work of the Personal AI Hackathon focused on emergency response and fire resilience, where pAI can assist in real-time decision-making, disaster communication, and situational awareness. Leveraging offline-capable, distributed AI, first responders and affected communities can access critical information and coordination tools without being overly reliant on fragile infrastructure services.

            Government agencies have a duty to serve the public. How do we ensure our digital services are usable by those who need them most? In this panel talk, we&#39;ll hear from folks at different levels of government. Panelists will talk about their experiences designing and building tech stacks that serve the public. How can we deliver services in any language? How can we make sure every feature works well on all devices? How can we publish information and documentation so that everyone can understand? We will discuss the benefits, challenges and constraints of using public code, open source systems, and open data.

            Your AI should be as personal as your pants, your car, and your PC. It should be yours and not a suction-cup on the tentacle of a corporate giant. We don&#39;t have that yet, but we will, And when we get it, the greenfield will be infinitely large—unless we settle for the personalized kind. Doc will explain the difference and how we can make sure personal AI wins.

             Maximizing Developer Productivity: Platform Engineers as Product Managers
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Platform engineering is the foundation of modern software development, equipping teams with the tools and workflows they need to move faster. However, to truly drive impact, platform engineers must think like product managers—leveraging productivity metrics to guide decisions, prioritize investments, and measure success. By applying a data-driven approach, platform teams can optimize developer experience, streamline workflows, and demonstrate tangible ROI on platform initiatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this 15-minute session, Justin Reock, Deputy CTO at DX (getdx.com), will explore how platform engineers can use key developer productivity metrics—such as cycle time, deployment frequency, and developer satisfaction—to manage their platform as an internal product. By treating the platform with the same rigor as an external product launch, teams can accelerate adoption, improve efficiency, and create a frictionless developer experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            Join us to learn how adopting a metrics-driven, product management mindset can transform your platform engineering efforts into a strategic, high-impact function that unlocks engineering velocity and business success.

            Port forwarding is a common practice used in networking to allow external devices to connect to services within a private network. While it can facilitate remote access, gaming, and the hosting of servers, it also introduces significant risks and complications that warrant careful consideration. This paper explores the drawbacks of port forwarding, emphasizing security vulnerabilities, increased attack surfaces, and the potential for misconfiguration.
           </p>
           <p>
            Port forwarding can lead to misconfiguration issues. Many users lack the technical expertise to set up port forwarding correctly, which can result in inadvertently exposing sensitive data or services. Misconfigurations can also lead to network instability and conflicts, hampering performance and accessibility. In environments where multiple users or devices are involved, the complexity of managing forwarded ports can lead to confusion and mistakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the advent of solutions like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), cloud services, and tunneling protocols, many of the use cases for port forwarding can be addressed through more secure and efficient means. These alternatives often provide better encryption, access control, and user authentication, reducing the reliance on potentially risky port forwarding setups.
           </p>
           <p>
            the ongoing trend of increased cybersecurity regulation means that organizations utilizing port forwarding may find themselves non-compliant with industry standards. This can lead to legal ramifications, including fines and reputational damage. Therefore, organizations must weigh the benefits of port forwarding against its inherent risks and consider adopting more secure alternatives that align with best practices in cybersecurity.
           </p>
           <p>
            While port forwarding may offer immediate benefits for specific applications, the long-term security risks, potential for misconfiguration, and availability of more secure alternatives suggest that it is not a prudent choice for most users. Emphasizing the importance of robust network security practices, this paper advocates for the adoption of safer, more modern networking solutions that prioritize user protection and data integrity.

            This hands-on tutorial will take you from a vi beginner or intermediate user to a Power User, able to leap tall text buildings with a single bound. Unleash the full power of that blinking cursor, become more efficient at your job, and fame and fortune will surely follow. Most people use only 10% of what vi is fully capable of. Awaken to your vi’s full potential.

            Target audience:  Anybody who has to edit files on UNIX-like systems. A sysadmin who’s been using vi for 18 years come up to me afterward and told me he learned something useful.

            Backstage Software Templates provide a consistent way for platform engineers to enable self-service delivery of cloud-native software components. Templates ease onboarding and daily development work by establishing the tools, services, documentation, and best practices as “golden paths” for users to navigate.
            <br>
            <br>
            Attendees will learn how to use CNCF products and technologies together to construct flexible foundations for cloud-native development using Backstage Software Templates, Helm Charts, Tekton, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and more, and will review common workflows for delivering and updating these offerings via the Backstage Software Catalog.
            <br>
            <br>
            Learn how to enable your teams to get to work immediately using your prescribed tools and technologies with Software Templates for Backstage.

            Transitioning from VMware to OpenStack involves more than just data migration; it requires preparing systems, teams, and processes for a new environment. This session will address cloud migration challenges from both commercial and technical perspectives, providing VMware users with a comprehensive approach to system preparation. We will cover essential aspects such as pre-migration resource planning, compatibility checks, user training, and infrastructure updates.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Attendees will gain insights into the technical preparations and cultural shifts necessary for a seamless migration with minimal disruption. Through practical and actionable strategies, this session aims to equip VMware users with the knowledge and tools needed for an efficient and effective OpenStack transition.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will also introduce FishOS Move It, an easy-to-use appliance from Sardina Systems that manages the entire process, from resource preparation to launching virtual machines in the new environment. While there may not be a magic solution to simplify migration, effective strategies can significantly reduce complexity.

            As observability advances to deliver deeper insights into system performance, traditional telemetry signals like logs, metrics, and traces are now complemented by advanced profiling capabilities, specifically with OpenTelemetry. Fluent Bit is leading this shift by unifying these diverse signals into a high-performance observability pipeline. This session will showcase how Fluent Bit optimizes log, metric, and trace handling at scale and supports OpenTelemetry schemas, creating a standardized approach to telemetry that integrates seamlessly with other observability tools.
           </p>
           <p>
            We’ll also introduce Fluent Bit’s new eBPF-based profiling, which provides powerful, low-overhead insights into performance and resource usage. Attendees will learn how Fluent Bit’s expanded capabilities make it possible to capture and act on detailed performance data with minimal resource impact. We’ll discuss practical use cases, best practices and a hands-on demo.

            In this hands-on workshop attendees will learn the basics of how to use Argo Rollouts to progressively roll out apps. In this lab you will learn how to:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Review the Rollouts specification
            </li>
            <li>
             Use Rollouts to perform a blue-green deployment
            </li>
            <li>
             Review the blue-green Rollout that were pre-deployed as part of the workshop
            </li>
            <li>
             Update the image with continuous integration and observe the blue-green progressive delivery in action
            </li>
            <li>
             Enhance the blue-green rollout with integrated testing by applying an AnalysisTemplate
            </li>
            <li>
             Update the image again and review how the AnalysisTemplate works
            </li>
            <li>
             Use Rollouts to perform a canary deployment:
            </li>
            <li>
             Review the canary Rollout that was pre-deployed as part of the workshop
            </li>
            <li>
             Update the image with continuous integration and observe the canary progressive delivery in action
            </li>
            <li>
             Observe that the canary is configured for a manual step, approve the promotion
            </li>
            <li>
             Observe the remainder of the deployment until completion
            </li>
            <li>
             Perform a rollback of the canary of the canary deployment
            </li>

            Zuul is a project gating system, which is like a CI/CD system that is primarily focused on ensuring multiple changes are well-tested with each other before being merged.
            <br>
            <br>
            Zuul works with multiple project git repositories and multiple code review systems simultaneously.  It helps bridge the testing gap between projects and organizations.
            <br>
            <br>
            It uses Ansible for orchestrating tests on multiple nodes.  It has no single points of failure.  It tests some of the largest Open Source projects in the world, and can run on your laptop.
            <br>
            <br>
            James Blair will share what makes Zuul unique, how it&#39;s used in Open Source projects like OpenStack as well as in the enterprise, and how you can get started using it to stop merging broken code.

            In today&#39;s enterprise landscape, the demand for agile, scalable, and resilient infrastructure is at an all-time high. Combining the power of openstack, a robust open-source cloud infrastructure platform, with OKD, a leading container orchestration solution, creates a synergistic environment that meets modern datacenter requirements. This presentation explores the benefits of running RDO openstack on OKD kubernetes, detailing how the integration optimizes resource management, enhances operational flexibility, and supports seamless cloud-native and VM-based workloads. Attendees will gain insights into deployment strategies, performance improvements, and best practices for leveraging this combination to drive innovation in enterprise IT environments.

            You&#39;ve heard of observability, you&#39;ve heard of the the three pillars, and you&#39;ve probably even heard of observability 1.0 vs 2.0. But, something&#39;s still missing. Our definitions of observability are so technical that they miss the real value: a process through which one develops the ability to ask meaningful questions, get useful answers, and act effectively on what you learn.
            <br>
            <br>
            In an era of tight budgets and doing too much with too little, executing an observability strategy that delivers meaningful impact can feel impossible. In this talk, we&#39;ll learn how to cross the chasm from theory into delivering value where it matters. As we do so, we&#39;re going to start bringing together every part of the company by understanding how building home baked abstractions unlocks interdisciplinary collaboration.
            <br>
            <br>
            The talk will be packed with concrete examples of meshing institutional context with operational excellence. We&#39;ll also go over actionable steps that can be taken regardless of where you are on your observability journey, regardless of what your budget is, and how to get started when you don&#39;t have time.

            In today&#39;s world, we have advanced tools for testing, building, and deploying applications, yet internal engineering documentation remains stuck in outdated practices like copy-pasting from wikis. To fix this, we need to rethink how documentation works, focusing on system dependencies, environment configs, cloud integration, and human-readable explanations. Drawing inspiration from literate programming (1984) and Jupyter Notebooks, Runme (runme.dev) introduces a new approach to Runbooks, playbooks, and onboarding docs—turning Markdown into interactive Notebooks and providing a TUI for hands-on experience.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            Runme streamlines the complexity of engineering documentation by addressing key challenges:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Automated testing for docs in CI
            </li>
            <li>
             Leveraging DevContainers to make doc deps reliable
            </li>
            <li>
             Handling config/secrets deps with typed .ENV files
            </li>
            <li>
             Integrating cloud-native tooling into docs
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="p1">
            In just minutes, engineers can create interactive, reliable, and fully integrated docs, transforming how teams manage their internal processes.

            Nix has builtin support for distributing builds to remote machines. In fact, any SSH-accessible computer with a Nix installation can be used as a build server! In this talk, I&#39;ll give an overview on how remote Nix builds work in practice, and talk about their possibilities and limitations. I&#39;ll also lift the lid on Nix and show how the remote builder protocol works. Finally I&#39;ll mention some improvements I&#39;d like to see in Nix, based on my experience on implementing the nixbuild.net service.

            How many layers can you put in a container?
            <br>
            Do you know why there&#39;s a limit?
            <br>
            <br>
            Containers are a fantastic virtualization technology.
            <br>
            They even have some packaging properties!
            <br>
            <br>
            However, we can learn a lot of new cloud-native magic tricks if we bring packaging discipline a little further through the stack of bits that make up our container image layers and OCI manifests.
            <br>
            Enter Nix.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nix uses stores that isolate individual packages into hashed folders that can be used independently from each other and combined with each other!
           </p>
           <p>
            Sounds a lot like a container registry, doesn&#39;t it?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            In this presentation, Tom and Leigh will cover the basics of Nix Storage and Packaging as well as the basic make-up of OCI images.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll then demo a few working solutions that extend and modify cloud-native interfaces:
           </p>
           <p>
            - nix expressions to build containers
           </p>
           <p>
            - nix-snapshotter to tell containerd to use Nix store paths instead of layers from a registry
           </p>
           <p>
            - node-local nix stores with per-container overlay caches for dynamic dependencies within container workloads
           </p>
           <p>
            - seekable OCI and /nix
            <br>
            <br>
           </p>
           <p>
            Come join in for a primer on Nix and Kubernetes with diagrams, demos, and Q&amp;A with Nix and Kubernetes contributors :)

            Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL is awesome because it lets you isolate each user or tenant&#39;s data, lock it down, and default to &#34;deny access.&#34; This makes RLS a powerful tool for enforcing security in multi-tenant applications. However, the RLS implementation in Postgres also has drawbacks; it makes assumptions about your application&#39;s design that may not be applicable in many cases.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your application wasn’t developed with RLS in mind and uses a single application user to connect to the database, using RLS meaningfully may seem impossible as it can require significant reworking of your app’s structure and logic, leaving many developers unsure of how to proceed.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this talk, we’ll look at practical ways to roll out RLS that allow you to take advantage of this powerful feature in the real world, even if your application’s architecture wasn&#39;t designed with it in mind. We’ll explore strategies to make the RLS feature work with existing setups and give actionable steps to make RLS work without requiring an extensive overhaul to the application.

            So far, efforts to use Nix as a build system have suffered from either insufficient incrementality or excessive evaluation time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sandstone is a new tool to plan Haskell builds using Nix that achieves full incrementality without affecting eval times at all. It does this by using the new experimental &#34;dynamic derivations&#34; to create fine-grained build steps without involving the Nix language *at all*.
           </p>
           <p>
            We hope that Sandstone will kick of a new era of language-specific tooling using Nix!

            Imagine that your program uses many threads, which insert and lookup millions times per second in a large data structure like std::map or std::unordered_map. Typically, you have to switch to a lock-free data structure for this task. Lock-free approaches perfectly scale data structures for multi-core systems, but hash tables and trees need some reorganization as more and more items are inserted and these reorganizations are hard to make lock-free. But the problem isn&#39;t only in contention and we also need to efficiently work with memory to develop a high performance data structure for the modern hardware. Cache conscious data structures address the problem by efficient usage of CPU caches and reducing the number of accesses to the main memory.
            <br>
            <br>
            This talk makes a quick survey over several lock-free (primarily variations of hash table) and cache conscious (mostly trees) data structures. We&#39;ll discuss the best use cases for the data structures and their limitations. Besides performance in average cases, we&#39;ll also focus on worst case scenarios, which may introduce high tail latency on large busy systems. Tail, or high percentile, latency is a severe problem since it may reach significant values and the small percent of problem cases can be not so small in absolute values, e.g. if you service 1M users, then only 0.1% of them experiencing high processing time is a problem.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main part of the talk is a step by step C++ implementation of Hash Trie, a hybrid lock-free cache conscious data structure, which provides good access time in average and worst case. We&#39;ll do microbenchmarks of the data structure and compare it with other data structures.
            <br>
            <br>
            You&#39;ll learn about:
            <br>
            * when standard containers and locking mechanisms aren&#39;t enough
            <br>
            * several advanced data structures: split ordered lists and other variations of lock-free hash tables, tries (partricia trees) and hybrid data structures
            <br>
            * x86-64 memory ordering and cache hierarchy, operating system preemption and how to employ all the knowledge to implement a very fast data structure
            <br>
            * gotchas of data structures benchmarking, such as keys distribution, latency vs throughput, worst cases and so on
            <br>
            * an open source lock-free cache conscius Hash Trie implementation

            By utilizing DevOps and cloud-native strategies, UCSB&#39;s College of Letters and Science hosts JupyterHub instances for over 50 courses and over 4600 persistent individual developer environments per year in baremetal Kubernetes environments.  This talk will highlight the methods to accomplish this, such as automated pipelines for keeping all of the container images continuously updated and tested via Jenkins, provisioning servers with immutable Linux on bare metal Kubernetes hosts via SUSE Rancher Elemental, leveraging Ansible and git to automate an open source load balancer stack in front of the clusters to reliably and securely serve environments over the public internet, optimizing storage provisioning for performance, cost, and scalability via Longhorn and Ceph, git-based CI driven pipelines for managing the lifecycle of Jupyter Notebook and RStudio environments to align with SLAs through a helm-based dev-staging-production deployment workflow capable of automatically rolling back, and utilizing operational logging and monitoring tools such as prometheus, grafana, fluentd, and opensearch dashboards to gain insights into the health of deployments and to better troubleshoot incidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Supporting containerized Python and R development environments is inherently challenging as dependencies break often.  This talk will demonstrate the value of using a CI to identify potential library problems or container image build problems ahead of time, while giving stakeholders, such as faculty or researchers, a means of optional additional manual testing current and upcoming changes to their container image backed environments.  This has also given us the opportunity to contribute back to the open source community by submitting issues and patches for issues as we often discover them quickly through the use of CI, so that other users and organizations can benefit as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            The move to baremetal Kubernetes was a DevOps success story in reducing latency, cost, technical debt, and overall time-to-live.

            At Dropbox, managing observability for systems producing terabytes of logs daily presented a unique challenge. Initially, developers needed to log into individual servers to view logs, a process that was cumbersome and posed security risks. With our shift to containerized environments, the challenge only grew as short-lived containers led to log data disappearing upon termination. We recognized the need for a scalable, centralized observability solution leveraging open-source tools.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this session, I’ll detail our journey to implement a robust observability framework, focusing on our decision to use Loki as our primary logging solution. Deploying Loki at Dropbox’s scale required extensive optimization to handle high data volumes and deliver reliable, efficient query responses. I’ll share insights into our approach to deployment, the challenges we faced, and the technical strategies we employed to achieve consistent, high-performance logging.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, we integrated Grafana for a unified view, combining logs and metrics for a comprehensive observability solution. This transformation not only improved troubleshooting efficiency but also enhanced security by offering a centralized, accessible platform for monitoring. Join us to learn how these efforts impacted Dropbox’s operations and the lessons we gained in scaling observability with open-source solutions.

            The benefits of running your containers in Kubernetes are clear: you get your slice of the resources available and can scale as much as you need, as long as Kubernetes has a slice to give you.

           <p>
            What happens when your cluster doesn&#39;t have enough resources? Typically, clusters are configured with an autoscaler that works with your cloud provider to provision more nodes, but what type of node will be provisioned? Is it going to be an instance with 96 vCPUs when you only need a fraction of one? What is it going to cost?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, we will go over the various capabilities of  Karpenter to get just-in-time provisioning for the resources you need. We will also show you how flexible provisioning can be, allowing you to take advantage of a wide array of instance types and architecture while being optimized for cost by utilizing features of your cloud provider, such as reserved and spot instances.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            This talk will be heavily geared towards sharing our experiences and how we leveraged Karpenter to provision thousands of nodes for burst traffic while dramatically reducing our cloud spend.

            Have you ever gotten a weird email or message that didn’t seem right? In our talk, “Scam-Spotting 101: How to Identify Phishing and Fake Messages,” We’ll share information about how to spot suspicious messages, emails, and websites so you don’t get tricked. Phishing is one of the most common scams, where attackers pretend to be someone you trust, like a bank or a popular game site, to steal your information. It sounds scary, but once you know what to look for, spotting a phishing message can be like solving a mystery. We’ll go over common red flags, like fake links, unusual requests, and messages full of spelling mistakes. We’ll look at real-life examples and play a game where we decide which messages are real and which are fake.

            Many organizations using VMware are considering OpenStack as a viable private cloud alternative due to its flexibility, scalability, and open-source nature. However, the migration process from VMware to OpenStack can present significant challenges, including concerns about application downtime, compatibility with existing workloads (especially Windows guests), and the complexity of managing large-scale migrations in an automated way. Some users may also be new to OpenStack and hence need an easy way to get started. On top of this, the cost of migration is non-trivial and can be a limiting factor for these organizations. In this presentation, we will discuss how you can overcome all these challenges with an easy-to-use migration tool called vJailbreak. We will also touch upon how this is not just “yet another migration tool” and how it differentiates in comparison to some existing alternatives out there.

            If you are dealing with application security, chances are you are familiar with the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, a globally acknowledged benchmark for understanding and addressing the most critical security threats impacting modern web applications. This widely recognized framework highlights vulnerabilities that can lead to significant risks if left unaddressed, such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions. While the OWASP Top 10 serves as a foundational guide for securing web applications, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Its implementation often requires adapting security measures to specific contexts, particularly as organizations transition to cloud-native environments.
           </p>
           <p>
            The shift to the cloud introduces a unique landscape of risks that go beyond traditional application security concerns. Factors such as shared responsibility models, dynamic scaling, and decentralized infrastructure demand innovative approaches that blend traditional AppSec practices with cloud-native solutions. These new challenges highlight the need for tools and methodologies designed to operate seamlessly within the complexities of modern cloud ecosystems, ensuring that web applications remain secure while supporting organizational agility and growth.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this session, we will delve into leveraging AWS-native tools to mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities effectively. Attendees will walk away with a comprehensive understanding of how to secure web applications in AWS using cloud-native tools. By shifting the focus of &#34;securing in the cloud&#34; responsibilities to application security (AppSec) teams and leveraging AWS-native solutions to handle &#34;securing on the cloud,&#34; this approach enables organizations to mitigate OWASP Top 10 threats effectively.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether you are a Cloud Security Architect, CloudOps Engineer, DevOps practitioner or Platform Engineer, this session will equip you with actionable insights and best practices to build secure, scalable, and resilient web applications in AWS. By the end, you’ll be prepared to tackle the evolving complexities of cloud-native security with confidence and precision.

            This talk introduces the open source tool GrimoireLab that can shine lights onto those dark corners of your open source supply chain. We will also show how GrimoireLab was used in a novel Risk Assessment Model for the Maturity and Sustainability of open source dependencies, designed to address this critical challenge.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            By using the GrimoireLab tool, combining concepts from the CHAOSS project and cloud-native deployment maturity models, our approach goes beyond traditional Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) analysis to evaluate the ongoing maintenance activity and community health of OSS projects. This enables organizations to:
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            - Assess the long-term viability of their open source dependencies.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            - Make informed decisions about library selection and integration.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            - Proactively mitigate risks associated with unhealthy or unsustainable communities.

            Strong passwords are essential to keeping personal information safe, especially online. Studies show that weak passwords contribute to around 80% of data breaches, meaning most security issues are due to easy-to-guess passwords. Using simple or common passwords like &#34;123456&#34; or &#34;password&#34; makes it much easier for hackers to break into accounts. A strong password, ideally a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, can prevent most of these problems. Fun fact: a password with 12 random characters would take millions of years for a hacker to guess! So, next time you make a password, remember to keep it unique and challenging— it’s one of the best ways to stay secure on the internet.

            In today&#39;s landscape of high-performance computing, enterprise datacenters, and even home labs, GPUs have become indispensable for solving compute-intensive problems. However, achieving scalable performance when using multiple GPUs is far from automatic. It requires careful consideration of the problem, thoughtful decomposition strategies, use of collective operations (e.g. AllReduce, Broadcast, AllGather, Scatter), and targeted code optimization to avoid bottlenecks that can negate the benefits of additional hardware.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, I’ll explore how workflows in enterprise environments, HPC clusters, and home labs alike can unlock the true potential of multi-GPU computing. Through examples drawn from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and AI/ML applications, I will demonstrate how using multiple GPUs can dramatically reduce time to solution and enable scalability for problems involving large, multidimensional datasets. I will also dive into science’s growing interest in GPU computing, focusing on how problem decomposition strategies can be tailored for multiple GPUs and how to identify and mitigate communication and synchronization overheads that can limit scaling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether you&#39;re managing an enterprise datacenter, leading an HPC team, or optimizing workflows for your personal projects, this session will provide actionable insights and tools to help you navigate the complexities of multi-GPU computing and leverage it to accelerate your applications.

            Source available software is thriving. We live in a world in which there&#39;s more code accessible, findable, and ready for use than ever. Even major corporations now talk openly and seriously about their OSS strategy. Now, more than ever, the entire world runs on open source. We won, right?
            <br>
            <br>
            While the good news is fantastic, the bad news is sobering: maintainer burnout is worse than ever, project support is low, and funding everywhere has dried up at an alarmingly fast rate.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maintainer burnout is now becoming an international supply chain security risk, but industry response has been to add more pressure and obligations onto the shoulders of contributors that are already overworked, undervalued, and increasingly isolated. Support disappears faster than it appears, and it seems like every day a new project is putting a banner on their website stating a desperate plea: &#34;Maintainers wanted.&#34; The story is playing out across a thousand projects — a story of thankless hours, long nights, and watching your family grow up without you; it&#39;s a story of forgetting what it&#39;s like to enjoy software because you&#39;re too busy being a combination therapist, crisis response team, conflict de-escalator, PR team, marketing team, and sales team; it&#39;s a story where our heroes lose, because they didn’t set out to be Hercules holding up digital worlds.
           </p>
           <p>
            For foundations, it&#39;s an equally ominous story: our open source and non profit foundations have long been a critical part of the glue that holds together the industry; they handle the thankless and intricate tasks of governance, and provide an integral legal, logistical, and operational bridge between industry and developers. The money and support they get sustains numerous projects, languages, and ecosystems. But now, too, that is drying up. Even companies that hire full time employees to work on open source have been divesting in the communities they rely on for their continued development and laying off long-time maintainers of the very projects their businesses depend on
            <br>
            <br>
            What can we do about it? How can we act? Can we still course-correct in time?
            <br>
            <br>
            This talk won&#39;t be able to provide solutions, because solutions to problems like this don’t come in neatly wrapped packages. Instead, it will be a painting, illuminating the scope of the problem and calling attention to the gravity of the situation, which often only gets discussed behind closed doors.
            <br>
            <br>
            The situation isn’t hopeless, but it is urgent. There are potential solutions we can utilize, and possible directions we can go. There are people and programs out there working right now to reverse the course, but heightened awareness and action is urgently needed. Right now, things are bad, and they’re getting much worse.
            <br>
            <br>
            What&#39;s next after awareness? That&#39;s for us to decide and act on together. But we can delay not a moment longer; for many, by the time you hear this talk, it will already be too late.

            This session will illustrate how to optimize your data platform for performance, scalability, flexibility, and reliability in OpenStack and OpenShift environments. We’ll introduce a software-defined, NVMe-based architecture that modernizes your open-source environments, seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, and delivers low latency, flexibility, and cost-efficiency for performance-sensitive workloads at scale. A modern architecture that eliminates the storage bottlenecks that cause application timeouts. If you&#39;re looking to migrate to OpenShift from VMware, using OpenStack, or modernize your infrastructure with performance, flexibility, scalability, and lower costs in mind, then don’t miss Lightbits Labs at OpenInfra NA.

            A lot has been made about Broadcom&#39;s price increases for VMware, and there has also been a lot of attention paid to the technological aspects of migrating to OpenStack. Instead, let&#39;s take a look at the economics of the migration and how much it actually ends up costing organizations to migrate both in terms of licensing costs, as well as switching costs.

           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Showing the long-term cost savings of migrating to a fully open and free platform from a proprietary one has mostly been talked about in terms of OS migration (e.g. Windows or UNIX → Linux) vs. a platform-level migration, such as VMware → OpenStack. By understanding the economics of such a migration, using real-world examples, organizations can make educated decisions and choices whether to migrate. By going through this migration to an open platform, they will end-up having total control over their infrastructure and not have to worry about problems like this again.

            Scientific discovery has long been a cumulative endeavor, each new finding built on a foundation of prior knowledge. Newton’s well-known phrase, &#34;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,&#34; perfectly captures this tradition of incremental progress. In the modern scientific world, however, this incremental approach has been better maintained in the written literature than in the computational code that underpins scientific analysis. As a climate scientist working on land-atmosphere exchange, I began my career as an empiricist, focused on field measurements and observational analysis, before moving into the domain of modeling. This experience has shown me firsthand how the current paradigm in research coding fails to facilitate long-term, incremental improvement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Typically, research projects last only a few years and are conducted by small, dedicated teams of fewer than ten individuals. During this period, these teams develop custom code to analyze data and model interactions, which culminates in a publication. However, without a framework for maintenance, extensibility, or community engagement, this code often becomes effectively obsolete after the publication. Future researchers cannot easily build upon this work, which limits the potential for scientific advancement and results in frequent reinvention.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this talk, I will outline the need for a paradigm shift within scientific software development, grounded in the principles of good software engineering. This approach calls for code to be open-source and treated as a long-term asset, enabling future scientists to build upon prior work as readily as they reference existing literature. Key components of this new framework include modularity, documentation, community engagement, and long-term maintenance practices. By adopting an integrated approach, scientific code can become an evolving infrastructure, empowering cumulative research in ways that were previously unattainable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such a shift will ensure that valuable insights in fields like climate science, which rely heavily on complex models of interactions such as land-atmosphere exchange, continue to support future discoveries. With this vision, we can better align scientific coding with the incremental spirit that underpins all scientific endeavor, fostering a more sustainable and collaborative approach to scientific innovation.

            Over 100 students later, we have learned a lot about how to structure and optimize the OpenInfra University Partnership Program (UPP). The UPP still aims to alleviate the Open Source hiring vacuum that exists in the tech job market globally, while benefiting students and the open source projects they work on in addition to the larger ecosystem the projects exist in. This talk will explain the lessons learned, complete with anecdotes, after reaching this benchmark. It will also take the audience through the planned improvement and save time for questions from the audience about how to set up a UPP between the OIF and universities they have contact with.

            The path from individual contributor (IC) to leadership in security engineering is often seen as a one-way trajectory—but what happens when the reality of management doesn’t align with your passion for deep technical work? Many security practitioners strive for leadership roles to drive meaningful change, only to find themselves frustrated by the bureaucratic and interpersonal challenges that come with management. Some return to IC roles, seeking hands-on impact, only to realize that true influence often requires a seat at the leadership table.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this keynote, I’ll share my journey through multiple transitions between IC and leadership, exploring the hard lessons learned at each stage. I’ll. discuss the common pitfalls of security management—perfectionism, imposter syndrome, and struggling to earn respect from engineering teams—and how to avoid becoming the kind of leader we once resented. Those willing to listen should walk away with one way to balance technical expertise and strategic leadership, how to recognize when it’s time to step up (or step back), and how to shape an engineering culture that values both strong leadership and empowered ICs.

            Kubernetes is the de facto operating system of the cloud, and more and more organizations are running their workloads on Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers many benefits, new users may introduce security risks like cluster misconfiguration, leaked credentials, cryptojacking, container escapes, and vulnerable clusters.
           </p>
           <p>
            This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of Kubernetes security, from protecting your cluster to securing your workloads. You’ll learn about RBAC, OPA, Security Contexts, Network Policies, and other security features. You’ll also learn how to exploit workloads running on a Kubernetes environment using Living Off the Land (LotL) techniques like exploiting Insecure APIs, Secrets Theft, Container Escape and Pod Privilege Escalation, similar to the ones used by real-world threat actors.
           </p>
           <p>
            This workshop is designed for both beginners and advanced students. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a deep understanding of Kubernetes security and the skills to protect your clusters and workloads

            Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is increasing in importance to all areas of Security, particularly Cybersecurity. Organizations use OSINT to hunt for threats and to conduct red team exercises. As the amount of information on the global Internet grows, developing OSINT skills can help attendees to perform better in their jobs and help to secure their organization on multiple levels. This session will present some of the most impactful OSINT techniques and tools, including newer AL and LLM methodologies, in a guided, immersive, hands-on format. The workshop is designed as a guided, hands-on session. All attendees will be expected to bring a laptop (a tablet will work for most of the tools, though not all) so that they can ‘play along’ with the exercises. Each technique or tool will be demonstrated live. All attendees will be challenged to utilize what they have learned by applying them to their own searches and projects.

            AI systems created and maintained by open-source communities are a natural counterbalance to corporate-owned AI systems. Similarly to

            , everyone can take some of the unused computing time on their devices, and contribute to a larger system. In this case, it forms a decentralized fabric to replace the storage and computation currently requiring expensive cloud resources from corporate providers.

            This session explores the intersections of technology and politics. Focusing on democractic participation we will be examining how digital infrastructures can foster democratic engagement and governance. We will focus on technopolitics. Technopolitics is a perspective on the interaction between humans and various forms of power that foregrounds the role of technical objects, systems, and logics in mediating this relation. Public Digital Infrastructe is key in empowering citizens, fostering transparency, and resisting centralized control through open-source tools.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are focusing on Decidim, a leading open-source platform for participatory democracy, and its role in different open government approaches. Through concrete case studies from Spain, NYC, and Brazil, we will examine how governments and civil society have used open public digital infrastructure to build citizen participation, foster trust, and enable collective decision-making.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond government-led initiatives, we will also explore how all sorts of communities, from Amazonia Indigenous Groups to Open-Source Devellopers use Decidim to democratically organize themselves and collectively decide. These cases illustrate how digital infrastructures can empower self-governance, transparency and trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will explore key questions around decentralization, examining how Decidim interacts with the DAOs and Fediverse ecosystems. We will also delve into why good governance is a critical challenge in decentralized systems, shaping their sustainability, inclusivity, and long-term viability.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, the session will invite participants to reflect on the challenges and opportunities in building democratic digital infrastructures. How can we contribute to strengthening these ecosystems? What are the next steps in shaping the future of digital democracy at our level? Through discussion and shared experiences, we will explore practical ways to support, sustain, and expand participatory governance in an increasingly digital world.

            While x86 servers certianly dominate the landscape in datacenters, they are not the only option for running an OpenStack environment.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll discuss some options for installation, and then examine the concrete example of how a dual architecture enivornment works in the IBM Storage Scale lab.  We&#39;ll also talk about some of the lessons learned and pitfalls when using OpenStack to test a software defined storage offering.

            We all know honeypots can reveal interesting details about threat actors and there tactics, but it’s not every day that a threat actors sends you their own credentials. Operational security is hard. In this session, I’ll share how my team and I developed a simple Flask application to emulate an exposed Docker endpoint, and how an everyday log review led to discovery the X-Registry-Auth header. The header turned out to be a DockerHub token. I’ll take you down the rabbit-hole on how my team and I pivoted for additional research and derived some level of attribution.

            This talk explores the transition to conscious, dynamic systems and business models in the era of intelligence. By rethinking how workflows, compute, and context flow seamlessly, we move beyond the band-aid approach of containerized apps forced to orchestrate. Instead, we embrace dynamic, natural, adaptive continuums that form the foundation for equitable, scalable, and sustainable agentic ecosystems. Highlighting the diversity of AI, expanding beyond LLM-generated responses from a single vendor to a butterfly effect triggered by events that transcend the physical world and flow across the digital realm to achieve meaningful outcomes. This approach establishes Knowledge-as-a-Service (KaaS) business models as the cornerstone of future value creation, unlocking the full potential of the agentic economy.

            <br>
            Is hallucinations a fundamental limitation of large language models (LLMs) ? At the CELEHS laboratory, we are curious about the answer, but in the meantime, we often use LLM-based embeddings instead of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to help us in our analyses. In clinical and biomedical settings, one hallucination may be enough to trigger a catastrophic failure, and this is why we are particularly interested by LLM-based embeddings as BGE and BERT, which enable us to compute cosine similarities between a query and elements of our databases, thus making sure our results will not suffer from hallucinations. One example of how we use them is to suggest variables of interest to a specific study, for example if a clinician studies bipolar disease, we would suggest to have a look at the use of lithium, which is an often used medication.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the number of embeddings models increases, we want to have methods to compare the clinical usefulness of these models. In our case, we found that BGE embeddings had very satisfying performance although showed some limitations, e.g. relating schizophrenia to leukemia and bacteria. Another promising model for clinicial use is SAPBERT, which however focuses more on identifying synonyms, while BGE focuses more on &#34;relatedness&#34; (as the relationship between a disease and a medication). The question that thus arises is, how can we efficiently compare BGE and SAPBERT ? We have clinician-curated databases that compile &#34;known pairs&#34;, i.e. two concepts that are related. These known pairs can be synonyms, parent-child relationships (e.g. bipolar disorder &#34;is a&#34; mental health disorder), or relatedness (e.g. lithium &#34;may treat&#34; bipolar disorder). These known pairs can function as &#34;true positives&#34; with which we can compute area under the operating curve (AUC) and positive predictive value (PPV) performance scores. However, depending on the clinical study, we might in one case want to prefer finding synonyms, and in another related terms.
            <br>
            <br>
            These reasons are why we have built R / Python pipelines for biomedical LLM semantic search apps, leveraging Python&#39;s GPU indexing capabilities, while using R for data management and evaluation purposes. While some R packages exist to leverage GPU capabilities, Pytorch is by far more used for these purposes, which brings with it more stability and optimizations. On the other hand, R is well-known to be very efficient for data management, evaluation and visualization, thanks in part to its large network of collaborating researchers. How should one go about to build reproducible and trustworthy pipelines incorporating the best of both worlds ? My answer is well-designed pipelines with Docker and Makefile.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this talk I will show my design approaches on how to build such pipelines. While R and Python both have capabilities to natively interact with each other, building Docker images that can run both a R/Shiny server and Pytorch CUDA can prove challenging. Thus I chose to isolate the two environments, each one relying on an independent Docker image, and having an Elasticsearch database as the intermediary. The evaluation database (i.e. the known pairs acting as true positives) is first built and written using R, then Python reads the output and indexes it in the Elasticsearch database, and finally R is spun up again to read the indexed embeddings from the Elasticsearch database and evaluate the performance. Docker Compose enables to have each R and Python environments communicate seamlessly with the Elasticsearch image, and Makefile is used to order sequentially the components. With this approach, we can easily update any component when needed, as well as index the database on a GPU-capable machine before exporting the indexed database to a non-GPU online server as Amazon Web Services.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the number of embeddings models increases, we will probably soon need to distinguish the best models for specific tasks, as finding synonyms or related pairs, and these case-by-case cross-examined studies can be efficiently implemented with R&#39;s capabilities, while Python can perform the GPU-related computations without needing to reimplement all the optimizations in R. To me, the future of open source AI and applied science will leverage a broad spectrum of capabilities, and a core question will be how to make these different environments communicate seamlessly while making them robust, isolated, and reproducible. In this talk I would like to showcase my own design approaches to such challenges.

            Fast access to unlimited resources has allowed many organizations to iterate and innovate quickly, scale rapidly, and turned many companies into &#34;tech companies&#34;. But, as with all things, it comes at a cost. In addition to growing and sometimes unexplainable AWS bills, there has also been an atrophy of skill as operational knowledge has been ceded to managed services and SaaS providers. Organizational resilience has been lost as vendor lock in wraps chains around your data and privacy. And the cost to the environment and sustainability efforts will impact the world around us for generations to come.
            <br>
            In this talk, you will learn about some of the ways that the era of cloud computing has made us overly dependent on a few vendors and how we can take more control of our journeys with awareness, rebuilding skills, thinking beyond the quarterly sales goal, and cleaning up our messes.

            We now live in a world where data is constantly generated and collected, from transaction logs and website clicks to IoT sensors and more. The ability to act on information as it arrives has become crucial for staying competitive in many industries. Stream processing enables organizations to harness data in real time, driving fast, informed decisions that impact everything from customer experience to operational efficiency.
            <br>
            <br>
            This presentation delves into the fundamentals of stream processing and open-source stream processing technologies. We&#39;ll go into topics such as how it’s changing the landscape of different industries (such as finance, e-commerce, and IoT) by improving upon existing operations and opening up possibilities for new opportunities. In the end, we&#39;ll show how to quickly set up a data pipeline to handle incoming streams of data.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll start with the core concepts behind stream processing, including how it&#39;s different from traditional batch processing, which is most commonly employed. Next, we&#39;ll go over where stream processing can deliver the most value—whether it’s detecting fraud as it happens, tailoring online experiences to user behavior, or monitoring critical infrastructure. However, stream processing is not a one-size-fits-all. So we&#39;ll discuss when and where stream processing is most effectively used, and when to look into other data processing techniques.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moving from concepts to application, we’ll dive into what a typical stream processing data pipeline looks like, exploring each stage from data ingestion and processing to real-time analytics and storage. To provide a broad overview, we’ll compare some of the most popular open-source tools and platforms used in stream processing. We&#39;ll compare commonly used messaging queues (Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc.) and stream processing tools (Apache Flink, RisingWave, etc.). Each of these tools plays a unique role within a real-time architecture, from handling data ingestion and ensuring data reliability, to enabling complex transformations and aggregations. We’ll outline the specific strengths of each tool, providing insights on when and where they shine within a modern data stack.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, we’ll bring these concepts and tools together by walking through a live demonstration of how to set up a simple yet powerful data pipeline. This hands-on example will guide attendees through setting up a pipeline that ingests data, processes it, and outputs actionable insights in real time.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end of the session, attendees will have a clear understanding of how stream processing works, where it fits into a modern data architecture, and how they can start applying these techniques to deliver value in their projects.

            In the before times, OpenStack operators met several times a year to network, exchange experience and to bring feedback to the OpenStack development community based on experience of using OpenStack in production at scale. OpenStack operators meetups happened in many places including : New York, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Mexico City, Boston, Barcelona, Philadelphia, Vancouver
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the pandemic, however, and with shrinking travel budgets, in-person meetups have become extremely rare. On the other hand, interest in OpenStack is growing again.
            <br>
            <br>
            We&#39;ll take a fresh, no-holds barred look at the status quo and discuss what might work for the community in this new reality.
            <br>
            <br>
            Notable achievements of past community meetings included much tech knowledge interchange, but we also successfully drove changes in how long OpenStack release documentation is kept on-line and productive discussions of why installations lag the latest releases. These discussions highlighted acute operator needs in a way that eventually lead to the long-term maintenance branches of OpenStack and then more recently the SLURP upgrade process.
            <br>
            <br>
            It seems potentially valuable to restart this community.  However, the old assumptions about how the community should stay in touch no longer hold. The community has lost many longstanding members whilst others have returned and yet more potential new community members are arriving given recent events in the competitive landscape.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many operators are not on the mailing list and do not do IRC. Some can perhaps be found on LinkedIn, some on Slack, some on Mastodon. Some video meetings are on Zoom (non-free), some on Jitsi.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let&#39;s see how much OpenStack operators community we can find and work out how, where and what to organise.

            Linus started his kernel project &#34;just a hobby, won&#39;t be big and professional&#34; and over time it morphed into a kernel that is the lifeblood of many corporations.

            The Linux Foundation does a pretty good job with the needs of corporations.   Now we need to make FOSS fun for the average person again.

            This presentation will offer a deep-dive into the platform moderation of GitHub and how its purpose and user group has driven it to develop unique approaches to content that differ from general purpose platforms. It will explore what makes a code collaboration platform different from other platforms, how addressing code as content influences GitHub’s content moderation approach, and how this approach is driven by the norms and needs of the software developer community. Using diverse case studies, we&#39;ll look at how GitHub has refined its approach to developer-first content moderation in response to technological and societal developments as well as notable incidents on the platform. This presentation is a condensed version of the recently published article, “Nuances and Challenges of Moderating a Code Collaboration Platform” authored by members of the GitHub Trust and Safety, Legal, and Policy teams.

            Gravitational waves were first detected by LIGO in 2015 and this has since become commonplace. The Event Horizon Telescope produced the first images of a supermassive black hole in 2019. This year numerous pulsar timing arrays simultaneously announced evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. All of these discoveries shed light on the most extreme gravitational physics in the universe. However, our opportunity to learn from this data is only as good as our ability to make theoretical predictions to test against it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The research community has spent years developing a plethora of software tools, frameworks, and infrastructure to make these tests possible. Numerical relativity—the practice of solving equations from Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity with advanced numerical algorithms—is built entirely on open-source software, much of it totally unique to the field. This makes it a wonderful open-source software success story: a research community that expands our understanding of the universe primarily by developing and sharing open-source software.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my talk, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the open-source software projects that drive numerical relativity research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Specifically, I will cover:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The unique challenges faced in general relativity research
            </li>
            <li>
             The software frameworks on which codes simulating black hole and neutron star collisions are built, enabling modularity and efficient scaling
            </li>
            <li>
             Clever tools for extracting and analyzing key observables such as gravitational waveforms and black hole images
            </li>
            <li>
             Current and future development trends in numerical relativity
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I will conclude with some reflections on what has enabled numerical relativity to become a thriving open-source ecosystem, as well as suggestions for steps we can take to further realize our potential in open-source science.

            This talk focuses on the implementation of large running environments that support the entire suite of products at a company - specifically for the use of sales engineers to demo any and all of the products. In the past the environments had been managed in a manual fashion and were open to changes from anyone - leading to difficulty maintaining parity and ensuring working environments. With the opportunity to roll out an entirely new kit, the responsible team at Grafana Labs set out to bring the best practices and tools to designing their new demo environments.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            Key technologies in the implementation revolve around running tools and products on kubernetes clusters, and automation of the deployment of these tools, as well as the clusters and  underlying infrastructure itself. Decision points will be discussed around CI/CD, Security, Cloud Providers, etc. Our final implementation involves OSS such as Terraform, Flux, Bitnami Sealed Secrets, Atlantis, Helm, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry, however along the way other tools were evaluated such as Vault, kubernetes secrets, TF Controller, Argo,
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            As we work through the presentation, we aim to be interactive with the audience. The format will discuss design decisions each step of the way, and especially focus on the choices that were made between different OSS options. There will not be a set right answer, and we want to work through the choices made by the audience to reach a final example state of the system. To work in a true “choose your adventure” format, different options will lead to different discussions in the presentation, and various “perils” and “successes” will arise as particular options are chosen.
           </p>
           <p>
            We hope that this presentation will help attendees learn skills for critical thinking around design choices of large systems with many components, and how to better assess OSS options and the caveats that they might hold.

            Herein we present a recipe to improve the security posture and prevent attacks on code integrity of Azure Linux Instances that are used to host container workloads.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Managing deployments at Scale
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            When operating on a large scale in Azure, we used image-based deployments to limit the number of bespoke instance configurations prevalent in the fleet especially at the O/S level. The primary components of a Linux based Virtual Machine image are the Kernel, Root Filesystem and several filesystems that are created over various disk partitions. We established the provenance and trust of all the binaries deployed in the fleet by requiring secure-boot that is engaged through Azure Trusted Launch. We implemented signature validation of the OCI containers through
            <em>
             containerd
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <h3>
            Protecting the Root Filesystem
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            We implemented DM-Verity Protection on the Root Filesystem which rendered it immutable at runtime. Any offline attacks including modifications to its contents would be made tamper resistant by the DM-Verity feature. We protected the DM Verity root-hash by saving it as part of the kernel command line within the initramfs and enclosing it in a signed Unified Kernel Image (UKI). The secure-boot feature verified the UKI signature which effectively is a verification for the enclosed kernel, the kernel command line including the DM-Verity root hash and the contents of the initramfs.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Runtime Code Integrity
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            We engaged the Integrity Protection Enforcement (IPE) feature which operates in the form of a Linux Security Module within the Linux Kernel. IPE leverages the immutable security properties of system components when making security decisions. It places itself in the control path of file access in the Linux Kernel and checks the provenance of the files to either being protected by DM-Verity, FS-Verity or their origin in the initramfs (which is verified by the bootloader) and grants access according to a configurable policy. By leveraging provenance to DM-Verity and FS-Verity, IPE also protects from offline attacks on the system.
           </p>
           <h3>
            IPE Policy
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            The IPE Policy is stored in the
            <em>
             securityfs
            </em>
            (which is used by security modules) and is expected to be signed by a key in the kernel’s trusted key ring.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Protecting OCI container layers using IPE
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Our chosen problem space consists of system workloads that are exclusively in the form of OCI containers. We enforce signature validation through containerd for all the OCI containers being inducted into the system. Additionally, it is required to protect the container layers from offline tampering. Therefore, we must enforce DM-Verity support on container layers. All the OCI containers share the same Linux Kernel from their host system which includes the single IPE policy that by default encompasses all the OCI containers as well as the host components. Therefore, the IPE LSM can be leveraged to protect code integrity for our OCI container workloads.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Chain of Trust for IPE
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            For performance reasons, IPE functionality relies on the provenance established by other frameworks such as DM-Verity. Secure boot is a necessity for IPE to trust content stored in the initramfs which is verified by the bootloader which in turn is verified by the firmware (UEFI). The UEFI DB contains the keys trusted by the cloud provider. When an IPE policy is updated, it is expected to have been signed by a key that is chained to the kernel’s trusted keyrings.

           <h3>
            Trusting 3rd Party Signed out-of-tree kernel modules through IPE
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            The Machine Owner Key (MOK) provides a way for users to add their keys to the system’s trusted key database to enable the kernel to securely load their modules that are not built by the entity that owned and signed the kernel. However, it is not scalable for a cloud provider to provision users’ keys through MOK on their platform that comprises thousands of hosts and millions of Virtual Machine instances.
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            The keys used to sign the out-of-tree drivers can be counter-signed by a key that will be provisioned in the kernel’s trusted key ring and the resultant key added to the kernel’s secondary key ring. This would allow the out-of-tree drivers to be loaded by the kernel in a trustworthy manner.
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Finally, if a volume protected by DM-Verity on the system and therefore trusted by IPE through the secure boot chain contains out-of-tree drivers being loaded by the kernel, we are contemplating if these drivers can be trusted by the kernel even if they are not signed by a key rooted to the kernel’s key ring.
           </p>
           <h3>
            SELinux
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            SELinux is another Linux Security Module that executes as part of the Linux Kernel and provides extensive Mandatory Access Control. Whereas SELinux cannot function while the system is offline and therefore cannot protect against offline attacks on code integrity, it complements IPE’s inability to enforce access control beyond code integrity. For instance, when SELinux is enforced, the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability will be required to change the IPE Policy file. Whereas IPE can enhance code integrity through provenance to verified and immutable system components, it cannot partition access between different roles on the system from accessing resources with no intent to modify.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Lifecycle
           </h3>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Whereas some scenarios are amenable to replacement, some deployments prefer to be updated in-place. Software will definitely need to be patched for security issues and bugs. Since we made the root file system immutable, one easy approach to patch it is to replace it using an A/B update with a patched version of it. This would require a partition design that would lend itself to such A/B updates.

            Multi-modal machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by enabling real-time disease detection through simultaneous video and audio data analysis. This session will walk attendees through the complete process of developing classification models that combine video and audio inputs to detect early signs of debilitating diseases. By deconstructing the model-building process, we’ll explore how to curate and preprocess multi-modal datasets, select appropriate model architectures, and effectively train models that can analyze complex medical data in real time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The session goes beyond theory with practical, hands-on guidance for building these models. Attendees will gain insights into creating video and audio classifiers from scratch and learn how to fuse these models for more accurate, real-time predictions. We will also demonstrate how to deploy these models in a live setting, showing how real-time classification can be achieved. Participants will leave with working code, a clear methodology for approaching multi-modal ML problems, and a roadmap to build models for healthcare or other domains requiring multi-modal analysis.

            Trusting a friend and trusting a service are fundamentally different. The former is personal and intimate, while the latter is impersonal and can scale to all of human society. The companies behind the current generative AI systems are poised to exploit that difference. Their intimate conversational nature will cause us to think of them as friends when they are actually services, and trusted confidants when they will actually be working against us. Like much of the internet, these systems will collect our personal data behind our backs and try to manipulate our behavior. Enabling trust in AI systems will require two things. The first are foundation models that are not controlled by corporations and the profit motive. The second is government regulation of the industry. Democratic governance is how we create social trust in our society.

            Let’s face it—most incident retrospectives are about as useful as debug logs without timestamps. They’re full of finger-pointing, hindsight bias, and theoretical scenarios where everyone acts with perfect foresight. It’s time to change the script. In this talk, we’ll explore a blame-aware, human-centered approach to incident management, where every incident becomes an opportunity for meaningful growth, not just a checkbox on the postmortem list.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            Instead of “who dropped the ball?” this approach asks, “what did we learn, and how can we make things better?” By focusing on quality observability, a
            <em>
             useful
            </em>
            service catalog, and leveraging a strong customer support team as our first line of defense, we’ll transform incident management from a reactive cycle into a proactive practice. We’ll dive into designing retrospectives that generate actionable insights without the usual counterfactual time-traveling (“If only we had…”) and that bring genuine improvements rather than finger-pointing.  We’ll look at ways to identify commonality between incidents to identify systemic issues instead of just classing everything as ‘code bug’.
           </p>

            With quality observability, we’ll demonstrate how teams can identify and resolve issues before they become five-alarm fires, using metrics that actually matter. We’ll discuss how to build a service catalog that doesn’t make you wish for the simpler days of “Ctrl+F,” helping everyone—DevOps, engineering, and support—stay aligned and informed. Finally, we’ll look at how to integrate customer support as a critical part of incident management. Far from being an afterthought, support teams offer front-line visibility into issues as they’re happening, making them invaluable partners for incident management and retrospectives.
           </p>
           <p class="p1">
            Attendees will walk away equipped with practical strategies to build an incident management culture that emphasizes continuous learning and real improvements. By the end of the session, you’ll be ready to lead retros that focus on insights over blame, avoid the “Groundhog Day” of recurring incidents, and leverage every incident as a chance to build stronger systems and stronger teams. Regardless of your role, this session will show you how to turn retrospectives into a powerful tool for continuous improvement and resilience.

            Replit.com is website used by millions of users to collaboratively create software with their teammates and now with Replit’s AI Agent. Replit uses Nix to manage the underlying development environments. When building a Nix environment, downloading files from cache.nixos.org can take a long time, and many files would be duplicated across Repls. In this talk, I will show how Replit uses Nix local-overlay-stores to manage Nix caching, as well as our new cache disk architecture using tvix-store.

             What is Universal Blue?
            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Universal Blue project builds custom bootable container images via OCI/Docker containers. One of the reasons the project was started was to test and validate this method of distribution and modification as a way to experiment with this new model to see if it is viable.

            Some remember what software development was like before Git; others can hardly imagine a world without it. Git is here to stay, and it’s a crucial part of any software development lifecycle.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            But how does it actually work? It almost feels like magic, but in reality it’s powered by data structures and algorithms optimized to solve specific problems.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            In this talk, we’re going to dive into Git’s internals. You’ll learn how Git stores files and their contents, explore the internal objects it uses, and see how it compresses and deduplicates data to optimize for storage and what gets cached for speed.
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            We’ll lift the mystery behind how Git syncs data between your local machine and a remote server, with a deep dive into Git’s smart HTTP protocol. Together, we’ll walk through what happens under the hood when you &#34;push&#34; data to a remote server. How the server knows what to update when you &#34;fetch&#34; an update or &#34;clone&#34; a new repository, and which bits and bytes actually git transferred (yes, there will be puns).
           </p>
           <p dir="ltr">
            This talk condenses hours of research into an informative, possibly entertaining session that will help you understand Git’s protocols, data storage, and performance optimizations — without sacrificing your sanity.

            The open source community is in crisis: There are jobs available at companies that don&#39;t understand open source while there are STARs (people Skilled Through Alternate Routes) who possess valuable skills but struggle to prove their competence. Adrianna Frick has spent years working to solve this gap and provide opportunities and paths to connect these two groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            Long before Adrianna led Canonical&#39;s efforts to launch a performance-based technical certification program for Ubuntu, she started as a hobbyist in the open source community in the late 1990s, and has had to prove her self-taught technical &#34;cred&#34; to access opportunities in tech from the dot com era to today. In this talk, she&#39;ll guide the community through the technical certification industry&#39;s best practices so that the self-taught home lab user will be able to recognize the differences between bad certifications, meaningless certificates, and credentialing programs that will actually provide value.
           </p>
           <p>
            We&#39;ll talk about what to look for in technical certification and course material to determine whether a program is developed with the proper instructional design necessary to provide a valuable assessment of relevant skills in a fast-paced industry.

            In this talk, Bryan will guide you through the
            <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkgs-dockerTools" target="_blank">
             NixPkgs&#39; dockertools ecosystem
            </a>
            . How to use it, what it actually does, what&#39;s cool about it, and its shortcomings will all be brought up. The Nix language is pretty weird at first to most people, so we&#39;ll start with a brief introduction to the language itself and what it&#39;s capable of. After showing the language, we&#39;ll jump head first into the so called dockertools ecosystem that NixPkgs offers.
            <br>
            <br>
            When we&#39;ve seen the basics of what NixPkgs&#39; dockertools can do, Bryan will switch to showing some of the cool projects that are happening around containers inside the Nix ecosystem. The spotlight will be directed at tools like
            <a href="https://kubenix.org/" target="_blank">
             kubenix
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://github.com/pdtpartners/nix-snapshotter" target="_blank">
             nix-snapshotter
            </a>
            . We&#39;ll see how these tools bring a somewhat native understanding of Nix&#39;s store model and expression language into the cloud native ecosystem.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bryan strongly believes that the cloud native industry and Nix are better together, so he&#39;ll close off by showing what the future holds, and some daydreaming of his about what he&#39;d like to see in the near future.

            VALKEY is a superfast in-memory distributed database with clustering, redundancy, and low latency. If you need a cache, then you need to look at VALKEY. The VALKEY project started when REDIS changed from an open-source license to extort money from its community. VALKEY is a much-improved fork of REDIS, and the Linux Foundation supports the project.   AWS, Microsoft, Percona, and many others are heavily contributing to make this a scuccess.
           </p>
           <p>
            This session briefly covers the fork&#39;s &#39;why,&#39; explores some exciting new features, and shows you how to start with VALKEY.

            From phones to TVs to wireless routers, our lives are increasingly defined by how device makers design the devices on which we rely.  But who do these devices really serve?  And why can&#39;t we fix them so they serve us instead?
            <br>
            <br>
            The recently-released OpenWrt One wireless router was designed from the ground up by Software Freedom Conservancy and its member project, OpenWrt, to give you everything you need to modify and adapt the device (including, of course, its software!) to fit you, and to ensure both the hardware and its software last as long as possible - no planned obsolescence!  We&#39;ll take you on a behind-the-scenes journey through the creation, manufacturing, and launch of the OpenWrt One, highlighting all the unique ways the One puts you first, while dealing with the joys and challenges of the modern hardware landscape along the way.  And we&#39;ll talk about why the One is making SCALE extra special this year!
            <br>
            <br>
            OpenWrt is one of many projects and initiatives of Software Freedom Conservancy.  Join us to learn about what else we are doing to both build humanity-first hardware and software, while also bringing the freedom you deserve to your existing devices.  We&#39;re excited to share more about what we do to bring you freedom and agency in your technology in practical and tangible ways!

            According to Wikipedia KiCad &#34;is a free software suite for electronic design automation (EDA). It facilitates the design and simulation of electronic hardware for PCB manufacturing.&#34; It is a workhorse for those who have used it, but is actually simple to get started with and should allow one to ease into doing more and more. This session will chronicle starting up with KiCad after only brief uses many years ago. The goal is to show a simple path for you to move first into recording simple projects like breadboarded arduino efforts, through simulation and then on to PCB layout where the end result will be files ready to be sent off to one of the many low-cost manufacturing services that have come to prominance in recent years.
            <br>
            <br>
            Even if you stop at just drawing and doodling circuit designs, KiCad is an invaluable tool. A simple, standard way to save what you have been doing is quite handy. Next, moving into simulation and electrical rules checking can of great assistance even for casual users.
            <br>
            <br>
            One helpful feature is KiCad&#39;s ability to export 3d models of boards for easier work creating custom housings and devices to be 3D printed (or CNC manufactured). Some examples of how to take this step will be illustrated, and can benefit all since even those who don&#39;t have a 3D printer themselves can submit things to services that provide multiple options for printing. May of the companies that provide PCB manufacturing services also provide 3D printing and/or CNC milling services.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, using KiCad to create Gerber files will allow one to get custom PCB&#39;s manufactured at low cost (and without the need to deal with hazardous chemicals). Get a few boards printed for testing and or selling on your own. Many of the providers also offer assembly services so you can even skip worrying about soldering.
            <br>
            <br>
            *If* my sample project works then I will have some custom electronics to show... if not, then I will have some valuable lessons to pass on so that you can avoid the pain I hit. Of course in order to have something complete there will be a few projects attempted, but all failures will be disclosed, as those are the most helpful part of learning!

            As an anthropologist on Meta’s Reliability Engineering team, my job is to integrate culture to applied systems analysis and to design and conduct interventions to effect positive change. This talk explores how we used anthropological research to help Meta make a 180-degree shift from “Move Fast and Break Things” to “Move Fast with Stable Infrastructure.” Instead of trying to go from one extreme to another, we used culture and the concept of behavioral “nudges” to drive change from the bottom up and top down.

            Specifically, this talk describes an ongoing intervention to provide appropriate levels of recognition for reliability work. The second explores a novel intervention that uses AI to ‘nudge’ engineers to reduce the likelihood of risky diffs from landing.

            AI is a hot topic right now, and for good reason! Natural Language Search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are two
            <em>
             great
            </em>
            methods to leverage data stored in Postgres in an immediately useful way. Why use Full Text Search when we can search for
            <em>
             intent
            </em>
            and related topics?
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually
            <em>
             doing it
            </em>
            on the other hand is a huge pain. We need to choose an embedding model to vectorize the data, then produce, maintain, and index the embeddings. Then we need to keep the embedding model around to similarly vectorize search parameters, and build queries for appropriate similarity searches. If RAG is involved, we need to choose a public Large Language Model API and juggle references fed to the system and user prompts, and relate that all back to our original data.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or... we can just use the pg_vectorize extension. Come to this talk and we&#39;ll show you how to build a rudimentary self-maintaining RAG application with just a few Postgres queries. We&#39;ll discuss a bit about the theory behind modern AI and how Postgres plays an integral part in that ecosystem thanks to pgvector and related extensions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mainly, we aim to demystify AI so
            <em>
             anyone
            </em>
            can use it thanks to Postgres.

            You need CI that can adapt as fast as the apps you’re writing. But often CI ends up being a bottleneck. For one CI PR you need to learn proprietary YAML syntax (every CI different) and how to work around its limitations conditionals, loops, functions, variables, ...which would be effortless if it was just a real programming language that you already know. You find yourself writing additional scripts and hacks to bring the logic to local dev. Enter the OSS Dagger project that brings CI as code (TypeScript, Go, Python).
            <br>
            <br>
            Brought together by a shared frustration with the confused state of CI and local dev tools for build and test, Rebecca and Jeremy will show how to build reusable CI/CD pipelines that can be written in real programming languages (not bespoke YAML) and &#34;just work&#34; together using the open source Dagger project (dagger.io). This talk will be good for developers/platform engineers or anyone else that needs a lightweight, code-based CI platform that can run locally and in any CI. If you’re technically curious, you should be able to build and share a module right after the talk (or maybe during!).

            As systems continue to evolve, they bring growing complexity with them: these include complexities in infrastructure and in software architecture. Having observable systems helps engineers manage this complexity. Many organizations rely on Kubernetes to run their software, and running the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Operator can help unlock the power of observability.
           </p>
           <p>
            The OTel Operator is a great tool that helps make your life a little easier by managing OTel for you in your Kubernetes cluster, by:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Managing the deployment of the OpenTelemetry Collector
            </li>
            <li>
             Managing the configuration of a fleet of OpenTelemetry Collectors via OpAMP integration
            </li>
            <li>
             Injecting and configuring auto-instrumentation into your pods
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, the OTel Operator can seem daunting to the novice user, especially when it doesn’t behave as expected.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this talk, Adriana and Reese will cover:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             An overview of the OTel Operator
            </li>
            <li>
             Common installation issues
            </li>
            <li>
             Common auto-instrumentation issues
            </li>
            <li>
             Common OTel Collector deployment issues
            </li>
            <li>
             …and how to tackle them all
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Attendees will walk away from this session with a better understanding of how they can leverage the Operator, and be empowered to use it with confidence.

            In this session, you will learn the importance of joining and giving back to a community. We will discuss the different roles within an Open Source Community and why they are all important and most importantly how everyone&#39;s work is important and has value.
            <br>
            <br>
            We will start with the different roles within a community touching on developers, technical writers, graphic artists, operators, and community advocates. We will discuss how these roles all come together to make up a community and how they work together to maintain one. We will also discuss how members of a community can work together to help grow the community through onboarding new members, mentoring, and also providing feedback to help improve both the project&#39;s output and the project itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the conclusion of this session, attendees should leave with a realization that what they do matters as well as how they help improve and growth their community as well.
